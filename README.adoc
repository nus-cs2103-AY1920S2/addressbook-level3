== What is it?

FlashSpeed is a text-based flashcard application specifically designed for university students who are learning a foreign language. University students often have hectic schedules. With this in mind, FlashSpeed was created to allow students to be able to study and revise foreign vocabulary on the fly. With a single command, you can start a quick study session on FlashSpeed whenever!

Keeping, flipping, and tracking physical flashcards can be a pain. FlashSpeed enhances the studying process by having virtual flashcards and a smarter review system. Users will be tested more frequently on flashcards that they had trouble memorizing previously.

By using FlashSpeed, you will learn faster and remember for longer!

== Who is it for?

FlashSpeed is intended for university students reading a foreign language module who need an effective way to memorize a lot of new vocabulary fast and for the long term. It can also be used by students who need to remember a lot of information (e.g. historical dates, definitions, etc.) before an exam.

Of course, anyone who needs a powerful memorization tool can benefit from using FlashSpeed!
