FoodieBot is a campus food locator application which can help students look for food they want, by recommending the canteens nearest to them.

Our target users are students, staff and tourists. In general anyone who comes to or visits NUS.

In particular, for the indecisive user, this application can give a random food suggestion tailored to each user based on their budget and/ or past food selections etcetera.
