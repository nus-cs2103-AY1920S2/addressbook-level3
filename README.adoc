Can you remember what you had 2 days ago, for lunch? How about last week? +

You already know how important a consistent diet is in shaping your fitness.
In spite of its importance, not everybody is tracking their meals. Why?
It is just too inconvenient and time-taking. You already have so many things to do and keeping track of what you
eat simply could not fit into your schedule. But, now it can.

Introducing *Calgo*, your personal meal-tracking assistant:

* Change the way you approach fitness: Calgo offers an all-in-one calorie tracker that is easy-to-use and guaranteed to save you from the frustrations of meal tracking. Bye bye complexity!
* Calgo's comprehensive reports also transform the way you approach your daily meals through intelligent suggestions on how to improve your meal consumption patterns.
* A lot of careful thought has been put in when designing Calgo to ensure that you have a smooth experience and won't end up spending too much time in learning how it works. Save that time for other important stuff.
* To evolve with the times and help you calculate your calories in a fraction of a second, Calgo is fully digital. It is a gift of convenience to you, packaged as a beautiful desktop application. I mean just look at our User Interface above. As the saying goes, pictures speak a thousand words but pictures of your consumption data saves you thousands of excess calories!
