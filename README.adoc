== What is Cardi Buddy?
Flash Cards allow you to learn _twice as fast_, and remember longer as proven by decades of cognitive science â€“ they promote studying through active recall, which is one of the practices through which our brains learn most effectively.

*Cardi Buddy (CardiB)* is a flash cards application that allows students to generate their own flash cards and test themselves through a simple Command Line Interface. Through making your own flash cards, you are _processing, summarising and internalizing_ the content that you have learnt and creating _stronger neural pathways_ as opposed to using pre-made decks.

If you can type fast, CardiB can also help you to store revision materials in a blink of an eye. Instead of revising by re-reading lecture notes, CardiB allows you _break down complex concepts into simpler questions_ in multiple flash cards and create test sessions to run through unfamiliar concepts.

In addition, CardiB comes with a multitude of features specially designed for NUS SoC students taking content-heavy modules:

* *Drag and drop images* into flash cards to cater to visual learners
* *Detect duplicates* of flash cards to prevent repetition
* *Tag flash cards* for better organization
* *Search for flash cards according to Tags* to access relevant topics more efficiently
* *Prioritise flash cards* that have a higher frequency of incorrect answers in quizzes for more effective testing

What are you waiting for? Give CardiB a go and you will be sure to see improvements in your examination grades to get that elusive A!
