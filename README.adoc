* This is a desktop Inventory Manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It facilitates easily management of stocks, which includes:
    ** warning when supplies are
    low
    ** easy sourcing of suppliers for selected goods
    ** expiry management
    ** seamless updating of inventory upon procurement and sales transactions
* This application is optimized for fast-typists. If you are comfortable with the keyboard,
Inventory Manager will be a joy to use!
