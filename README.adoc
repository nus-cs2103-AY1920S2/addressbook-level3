Welcome to *Sharkie*!

* *Sharkie* is an all-in-one desktop application for those who are beginning to see the importance of tracking your money (looking at you, university students).
* *Sharkie* not only tracks your incomes and expenses - it also acts as a (friendly) loan shark to help you chase down money that your friends owe you.
* They may forget their debts, but *Sharkie* never will! ðŸ’°ðŸ¦ˆ
