Have you ever sent out an internship application only to find out that you have already applied to that company already?
Have you ever wondered which stage of an internship application you should put more effort into?
As you send internship applications to many different sites and companies, it may be hard or troublesome to keep track of all your applications.
We want to make it easier for you -- by helping you to track your internship applications.

Internship Diary is a desktop internship application tracker that simplifies the process of tracking your internship applications, so that you can focus
on landing your dream internship. If you are a computer science student who loves dabbling with a Command Line Interface (CLI), then this application is for you.
