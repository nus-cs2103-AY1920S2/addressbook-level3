TA-Tracker
is a productivity tool made for *NUS School of Computing (SoC) Teaching Assistants (TAs)*
who want to be able to track and manage their *students* and *claimable
hours* in one place.

Teaching Assistants at SoC have to keep a track of:

* claimable hours so that they can fill up the TSS Claims form at the end of each semester.
* teaching-related sessions with claimable hours
* students and their contact information
* students' participation marks
* notes for certain students (such as recommendations)

Rather than managing this through several excel
spreadsheets and notes, TA-Tracker
allows TAs to track everything in a single, convenient-to-use
platform.

In particular, TA-Tracker
is a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* application packaged
with a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. This means that users are expected to interact
with the TA-Tracker
mainly through the command line, and each command executed will
evoke a visual response in the TA-Tracker.
