The mathematization of science in the 17th Century - from Descartes use of coordinate geometry to Galileo\u2019s Principle of Inertia and the mathematics of motion will serve to showcase how the early concepts took shape.\n- The mathematical strand will serve to showcase how Euclid\u2019s axiomatic approach to geometry formed the basis of subsequent generalizations that led to the characterization of space and time. Here students will be introduced to structures such as topological spaces, manifolds and Riemannian spaces that form the basis of the space-time fabric.\n- The physical strand will touch on the notion of physical symmetries and its relation to geometry. In particular, Galilean and Special relativity will serve to elucidate how the motion of particles in the space-time fabric reveals its geometrical structure.

Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions.

Does \"mind\" reduce to brain activity? Or is it more than just the electro-chemical exchange between neurons? As minded creatures with brains ourselves, the ways in which we delimit the mind/brain relation has enormous consequences for the ongoing construction of our legal, social, medical and ethical lives. In this module, we will study some of the major approaches to this issue, and attempt to discover what it is that we are really talking about when we are talking about \"mind.\"", "title": "Writing & Critical Thinking: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on 'Mind'", "department": "University Scholars Programme", "faculty": "University Scholars Programme", "workload": [0, 4, 0, 0, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "UWC2101R", "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "USP-SR2", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12}, {"classNo": "02", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "USP-SR2", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12}, {"classNo": "02", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1600", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "USP-SR2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12}, {"classNo": "01", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "USP-SR2", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 12}]}]}, "UWC2101S": {"acadYear": "2019/2020", "description": "This module introduces students to skills necessary for writing an academic essay.

In this regard, is \"danger\" constructed to foster national solidarity and identity?
