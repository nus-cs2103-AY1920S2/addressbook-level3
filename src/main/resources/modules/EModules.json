questions on short-run macroeconomic fluctuations, and shows how these tools can be applied to real world situations.  In the process of developing these tools, we will discuss the determinants of consumption and investment.  Next we turn to different business cycle theories.  Specifically, we study the  Keynesian, New Keynesian, Neo Classical and Real Business Cycle models, and examine their different assumptions and policy prescriptions for macroeconomic stabilization.   IS-LM and AD-AS frameworks are employed in studying some or all of these paradigms.   Finally, we evaluate the predictions of these models against business cycle facts.  We will also briefly review national income accounting and discuss some measurement issues.", "title": "Macroeconomic Analysis I", "department": "Economics", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science",

It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework.  After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games.  Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm.
