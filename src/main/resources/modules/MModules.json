After introducing the basic terminology and a classification of fluid and flow, students are taught fluid statics, which cover hydrostatic forces on submerged bodies, surface tension forces, buoyancy, metacentric height and stability of floating bodies. Numerous examples of engineering applications pertaining to each aspect\nof fluid statics are presented. In the section on fluid dynamics, basic principles of fluid motion are introduced. This covers the continuity equation, Bernoulli and energy equations. The momentum equation and its engineering application using the control volume approach are included. In the analysis of fluid-mechanics problems, dimensional analysis and similitude are taught with engineering examples. On viscous flow in pipes, laminar and turbulent pipe flows, Hagen-Poiseuille law, friction factor, losses in pipe fittings and use of Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chart will be covered. This module ends with an introduction to pumps, their elementary theory and matching pump and system. characteristics.", "title": "Fluid Mechanics I", "department": "Mechanical Engineering",

This covers the continuity equation, Bernoulli and energy equations. The momentum equation and its engineering application using the control volume approach are included. In the analysis of fluid-mechanics problems, dimensional analysis and similitude are taught with engineering examples.

What role did Star Trek's Lt Uhura play in recruiting astronauts to the NASA space program? How might The Day After Tomorrow impact the public understanding of climate change?\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the impact of fictional representations of science and scientists on public perceptions of science. It introduces research, theory and methods from this growing area of science communication as applied to fictional works including films, television programs, plays, novels, short stories and comics. Students are encouraged to share their own experiences of science-based fiction and to pursue their areas of interest through assessment. The major piece of assessment is a research project testing students' hypotheses about the impact that a work of fiction might have on public perceptions of science. The research project will be completed individually, but the research ideas will be developed as a team with a view to obtaining publishable results.", "title": "Science in Popular Fiction", "department": "FoS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Science", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "MW5258", "semesterData": []}, "MW5259": {"acadYear": "2019/2020", "description": "This course will prepare students to communicate science across cultural boundaries.

Students will explore how values, beliefs and expectations differentiate science from other knowledge systems, and examine the Eurocentric privileging of modern science and its communication, which are integral parts of Western culture.

It will also give you opportunities to learn and practice skills needed to participate in and facilitate dialogue. Assessment items will require students to plan and conduct a mini-dialogue.\n\nScience dialogue refers to communication about science that brings all parties to greater understanding. The key feature is that science dialogue is bi-directional - information and insights are gained on both 'sides'. In the\ncase of dialogue between scientists or science communicators and members of the public, then, the public participants learn about the science and the\nscientists' aims and aspirations, and the scientists learn something from the public, about their concerns and aspirations and generally about the social context of the science, which informs their thinking, and potentially their\ndecisions, about that science. Dialogue has a special place within science communication as a communication medium with particular aims that is increasingly being promoted as a best practice approach within government\nand community sectors.", "title": "Science Dialogue Theory and Practice", "department": "FoS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 1, 0, 4, 4.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "MW5272", "semesterData": []}, "MW5273": {"acadYear": "2019/2020", "description": "Politicians, chief scientists and others are increasingly calling for scientists to communicate their work with the public, but how, where and when did this start? Why have scientific societies like the Royal Society of London transitioned from doing scientific research in the seventeeth century to promoting the interests of science in the twenty-first? Are there parallels between eighteenth century amateur science and citizen science today, or\nbetween nineteenth century science popularisation and today's science journalism? How can we map institutional relationships between science and the bodies that promote it, popularise it, and link it to political processes? Is science communication an added extra in the world of science, or integral to its success and longevity?\n\nThis course applies historical and institutional approaches to science communication to explore the big picture view of how this discipline and its professional practices have developed across the world and through time. Students will map the relationships between science and the science\ncommunication-type activities and organisations that have always surrounded and supported western science as an institutionalised pursuit - scientific societies, advocacy for science funding, science professionalisation measures,\nscience popularisation efforts of different kinds, science museums and centres, and more. Course assessment emphasises reflection on the significance of this big picture for professional practice in science communication, as well as developing science communication research skills.", "title": "Making Modern Science", "department": "FoS Dean's Office", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 7, 2.5], "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "MW5273", "semesterData": []}}
