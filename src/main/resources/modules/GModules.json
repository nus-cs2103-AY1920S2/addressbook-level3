Through the close study of films by great directors, this module explores how film as an artistic medium can be used to engage with significant socio-cultural and existential concerns. Students will be taught how to analyze film as an artistic medium and, further, how film directors use the aesthetic elements of film to engage with important subjects. Through films by directors like Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, Wong Kar-Wai and Zhang Yimou, students get a chance to reflect on issues like the human condition, the family, the urban condition, love and society, and the nation.", "title": "Film Art and Human Concerns", "department": "English Language and Literature", "faculty": "Arts and Social Science", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 4, 3], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEK2020", "attributes": {"su": true}, "aliases": ["GEH1053"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 1, "timetable": [{"classNo": "W6", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS4-0109", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 1}, {"classNo": "W3", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1000", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS3-0303", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 1}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1000", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT12", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 6}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "1200", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LT12", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 6}, {"classNo": "W2", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS4-0206", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 1}, {"classNo": "W1", "startTime": "1300", "endTime": "1400", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS4-0206", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 1}, {"classNo": "W4", "startTime": "1400", "endTime": "1500", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS7-0106", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 1}, {"classNo": "W5", "startTime": "1100", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "AS1-0303", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 1}], "examDate": "2019-11-26T05:00:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}]}, "GEK2022": {"acadYear": "2019/2020", "preclusion": "GEH1014", "description": "This module challenges the foundation of human knowledge.

Islamic calligraphy\nIn the second section, ideas and movements from the Renaissance in Italy to the end of the 20th century in Europe, are surveyed.", "title": "Reading Visual Images", "department": "Architecture", "faculty": "Design and Environment", "workload": [2, 2, 0, 0, 6], "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "GEK2044", "attributes": {"su": true}, "semesterData": []}, "GEK2045": {"acadYear": "2019/2020", "description": "To develop a basic understanding of the major principles of contemporary architecture and urbanism from mid-nineteen century to the present; To study the making of architectural and urban language as they have been evolved and developed within specific social, political, cultural, technological and economic contexts; and to develop critical perspectives regarding contemporary architectural practice, the design process, and perceptions of the built environment.

For a start, this module introduces six dominant modes of questioning from the perspective of computational thinking, design thinking, engineering, philosophy, science, and social sciences. These six perspectives serve as a starting point to introduce all undergraduate students to different modes of questioning across these disciplines, and provide an initial exposure to how scholars from these disciplines pursue specific lines of questioning of everyday issues. We emphasize that while there is only limited time and space within one module to devote to specific disciplinary lines of investigations, we encourage all students to actively think about other lines of questioning, other questions that need to be asked, particularly in disciplines not represented in this introductory platform as we move through this journey together. We expect that in future subsequent offerings, other disciplinary modes of investigations may also be introduced.", "title": "Asking Questions", "department": "Office of Sr Dy Pres and Provost",

For a start, this module introduces six dominant modes of questioning from the perspective of computational thinking, design thinking, engineering, philosophy, science, and social sciences. These six perspectives serve as a starting point to introduce all undergraduate students to different modes of questioning across these disciplines, and provide an initial exposure to how scholars from these disciplines pursue specific lines of questioning of everyday issues. We emphasize that while there is only limited time and space within one module to devote to specific disciplinary lines of investigations, we encourage all students to actively think about other lines of questioning, other questions that need to be asked, particularly in disciplines not represented in this introductory platform as we move through this journey together. We expect that in future subsequent offerings, other disciplinary modes of investigations may also be introduced.", "title": "Asking Questions", "department": "Office of Sr Dy Pres and Provost",

The science behind global change (climate variability and change, natural weather disasters such as floods and droughts, environmental degradation); human aspects of change (water crises and conflict, agriculture and food security, energy sustainability, climate, health); and technology and policy issues relating to mitigation and adaptation (renewable energy, carbon trading, water resource

What are some potential complications to keep in mind as we plan what data to collect and how to use them to address our particular issue? When two things are related (e.g. smoking and cancer), how can we tell whether the relationship is causal (e.g. smoking causes cancer)? How can quantitative reasoning help us deal with uncertainty or elucidate complex relationships? These and other questions will be discussed using real world examples.", "title": "Quantitative Reasoning", "department": "Office of Sr Dy Pres and Provost", "faculty": "NUS", "workload": [2, 1, 0, 3,

Why do we need axioms and what are undefined terms? What are analogies and generalizations in mathematics?
