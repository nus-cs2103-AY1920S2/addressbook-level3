The carriage of goods by sea forms an important component of a wider body of law which is called maritime (or shipping) law. The subject matter of this course also forms a part of the (private) law of international trade and will assist those students studying international sales of goods and bank payment mechanisms in international trade, and insurance\nand marine insurance. All these subjects are invaluable to anyone who aspires eventually to work in shipping or international trade, whether as a lawyer in a law firm, as a legal adviser in-house, in insurance in a P & I Club, or for a\nmarine insurer.\n\nCarriage of Goods by Sea is a core area of shipping law. The principal purpose which underlines this course is the carriage of cargo from one destination to another for profit. The seller/owner of goods who wishes to export them will\nhire a ship (particularly in the case of bulk commodities, such as oil) or space on a ship, depending on the quantity and type of goods to be transported. This course is therefore concerned with examining the legal relationships which arise between the shipper (or owner of the goods), the carrier (the shipowner), the charterer, and the receiver/consignee of the goods. The particular emphasis\nwill be the principal documents of carriage, such as bills of lading, sea waybills and ship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivery orders, and the domestic legislation which governs these documents and also gives effect to international conventions.

These include a multitude of factors, such as legal considerations, the quantity of funding required and cost of capital depending on its source, and impact on shareholders and management etc. Corporations may also obtain finance by either levering existing assets or resorting to unsecured bank lending or bond issues. For the biggest corporations the most important source of finance tends to be the capital markets. These normally comprise the debt and equity markets through which public companies can offer securities to investors or to transfer the control of the company to new owners in the context of an agreed takeover, a hostile take-over bid, or of a private equity transaction.\nThis course aims to develop a critical understanding of the subject matter through the combined study of finance theory, corporate law, capital market regulation and the corporate market dynamics, with a special focus on the different stakeholders involved in corporate finance. The module will focus on critical corporate finance issues such as: the use of debt and equity; why merge or acquire a business; core considerations of the process; purchase sale agreements and contractual governance; the role of the board of directors in an acquisition/financing transaction; the permissibility and regulation of takeover defenses in the UK, the US and the EU. It will also discuss cross-border IPOS, the problem of market abuse, theory and practice of corporate takeovers and their regulation, and issues pertinent to private equity transactions, as well practical issues relating to structuring corporate acquisition deals and attendant legal documentation.

Foreign investors often arbitrate their disputes with host States via an arbitration clause contained in a contract. Additionally, investment treaties also empower foreign investors to bring claims in arbitration against host State. The distinct body of law that grew into international investment law, has become one of the most prominent and rapidly evolving branches of international law. The aim of this course is to study the key developments that have taken place in the area. It deals with questions of applicable law, jurisdiction, substantive obligations, as well as award challenge and enforcement, in both investment contract arbitration and investment treaty arbitration.", "title": "International Investment Law and Arbitration", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "workload": [3, 0, 0, 0, 10], "prerequisite": "NUS Compulsory Core Curriculum or its equivalent", "moduleCredit": "5", "moduleCode": "LL6150V", "aliases": ["LL5150V", "LL4150V"], "semesterData": [{"semester": 2, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1200", "weeks": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "venue": "LAW_SR4-2", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Seminar-Style Module Class", "size": 1}]}]}, "LL6153": {"acadYear": "2019/2020", "description": "", "title": "International Police Enforcement Cooperation", "department": "FoL Dean's Office", "faculty": "Law", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "LL6153", "semesterData": []}, "LL6155": {"acadYear": "2019/2020", "description": "This seminar will explore several key topics at the intersection of law and economics.

What can commercial or investment banks and financial regulation achieve in this regard, how is risk management structured, and what academic or other (political) models are used in this connection, how effective are they, e.g. in the capital adequacy and liquidity requirements, and what can or must governments and/or central banks or other regulators do when all fails and financial crises occur? From a legal point of view, an important aspect is the strong public policy undercurrents in the applicable law.\n\nThat is obvious in regulation but may also impact on private law. Another important issuer is that the law applicable to financial products and their regulation is ever more transnationalised and expressed at the international level, especially in terms of transactional and payment finality, financial stability, and even banking resolution facilities or international safety nets.
