But as both disciplines advanced, it became increasingly clear that the interactions between them are far more pervasive and fundamental than one might expect. For example, the field of biophysics has risen since the 1950s, and it has vastly changed how biologists look at living systems or study biology. It proved that the mindsets of biology and physics can join together to provide deeper insight into the phenomenon we call life. We will base the material on the basic laws of physics, and discuss how they are interwined with all kinds of life science and daily life phenomena, from cells to ecosystems and from Earth to outer space.

It consists of two sections: the first deals with the design of psychological research; the second covers basic descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. Students will be taught how to design their own empirical study, to carry out appropriate statistical analyses on the data collected so as to draw valid conclusions, and how to write up their findings.
