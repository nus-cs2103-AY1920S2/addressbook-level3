The lectures will\nconclude with real-life applications led by practitioners.", "title": "Forensic Toxicology and Poisons", "department": "Biological Sciences", "faculty": "Science", "workload": [2, 1, 1, 3, 3], "prerequisite": "LSM1306 Forensic Science or with department approval", "moduleCredit": "4", "moduleCode": "SP4263", "attributes": {"ssgf": true}, "semesterData": [{"semester": 4, "timetable": [{"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-15", "end": "2020-07-22"}, "venue": "S16-0307", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1300", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-24", "end": "2020-07-24"}, "venue": "S16-0309", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-13", "end": "2020-07-20"}, "venue": "LT31", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-15", "end": "2020-07-22"}, "venue": "LT31", "day": "Wednesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-14", "end": "2020-07-21"}, "venue": "S16-0307", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-16", "end": "2020-07-16"}, "venue": "S16-0307", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-17", "end": "2020-07-17"}, "venue": "S16-0307", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-24", "end": "2020-07-24"}, "venue": "LT31", "day": "Friday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-13", "end": "2020-07-20"}, "venue": "S16-0307", "day": "Monday", "lessonType": "Tutorial", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-23", "end": "2020-07-23"}, "venue": "LT31", "day": "Thursday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45}, {"classNo": "1", "startTime": "0900", "endTime": "1800", "weeks": {"start": "2020-07-14", "end": "2020-07-21"}, "venue": "LT31", "day": "Tuesday", "lessonType": "Lecture", "size": 45}], "examDate": "2020-07-24T06:30:00.000Z", "examDuration": 120}], "prereqTree": "LSM1306"}, "SP4264": {"acadYear": "2019/2020", "description": "The central dogma of Forensic Science is \u201cevery contact\nleaves a trace\u201d, popularly known as the Locard\u2019s principle.\nHowever, in reality, juxtaposed against this central dogma\nis that evidence of absence is not necessary absence of\nevidence.
