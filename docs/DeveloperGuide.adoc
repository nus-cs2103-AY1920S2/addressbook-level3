== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecipeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `RecipeBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed git back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Simplified Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The diagram above has been simplified in order to provide a clearer Overview of the Model component. +
The `Model` consists of 4 main sections: recipe, plan, record and quote. +
For more details on each of the main sections of the `Model`, please refer to the corresponding models
illustrated in the next few sections of this document.

The `Model` component stores a,

* `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* `RecipeBook` object that stores all recipes.
* `PlannedBook` object that stores all plans.
* `CookedRecordBook` object that stores the records of all the cooked recipes.
* `QuoteBook` object that stores all quotes.

It also exposes five unmodifiable lists that can be 'observed' by the `UI`: +

* `ObservableList<Recipe>`
* `ObservableList<Plan>`
* `ObservableList<Record>`
* `ObservableList<GoalCount>`
* `ObservableList<Quote>` +
The `UI` can be bound to these lists so that the `UI` automatically updates when the data in the list changes. +

The `Model` does not depend on any of the other three components. +

==== Recipe Model
.Structure of the Recipe Model
image::ModelRecipeClassDiagram.png[]

The Recipe Model stores the `UniqueRecipeList` containing all recipes.

Each `Recipe` consists of,

* One `Name`
* One `Time`
* Any number of `Step`
* At least one `Ingredient`

For a more comprehensive description on the structure of a Recipe, please refer to
<<UserGuide#, The Anatomy of a Recipe>> in our User Guide.

==== Plan Model
.Structure of the Plan Model
image::ModelPlanClassDiagram.png[]

The Plan Model stores the,

* `UniquePlannedList` which contains all plans
* `PlannedRecipeMap` which  maintains the mapping from `Recipe` to all the plans that uses this `Recipe`

Each `Plan` consists of,

* One `Date`
* One `Recipe`

==== Record Model
.Structure of the Record Model
image::ModelRecordClassDiagram.png[]

The Record Model stores the `UniqueRecordList` which contains all records.

Each `Record` consists of,

* One `Date`
* One `Name` from a `Recipe`
* One set of `Goal` list

==== Quote Model
.Structure of the Quote Model
image::ModelQuoteClassDiagram.png[]

The Quote Model stores the `UniqueQuoteList` which contains all quotes.

Each `Quote` consists of one `Content`.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

In the figure above, we can see that we are maintaining 5 different storages. These storages aim to keep the memory of:

* `UserPrefs`
* `RecipeBook`
* `PlannedBook`
* `CookedRecords`
* `QuoteBook`

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the HYBB data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.recipe.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::basic[]
=== Basic commands


==== Switch command (Harshita)
The `switch` command is facilitated by the `MainWindow`, `MainTabPanel`, `SwitchCommandParser` and `SwitchCommandParser`.

The following lists in sequential order the process of how `switch` behaves with user input.

*The user launches HYBB and the default start tab is set to the recipes tab.

*The user now executes `switch planning` to view the planning tab.

*`LogicManager` uses `RecipeBookParser#parseCommand()` to parse the input from the user upon execution of the `switch` command.

*`RecipeBookParser` determines which command is being used and creates `SwitchCommandParser` to parse the input
from the user to obtain the arguments.

*`SwitchCommandParser` parses the argument and checks its validity. If it is invalid,
`SwitchCommandParser` throws an exception and terminates. Else, it returns a `SwitchCommand` that contains a `Tab`.

* `LogicManager` uses `SwitchCommand#execute()` to switch to the planning tab.

* `SwitchCommand` returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` with the `Tab`. `LogicManager` then
returns the `CommandResult` to `MainWindow`.

* `MainWindow` checks if there is a change in state for `Tab` and if switching is needed. If there is, `MainWindow` uses
`MainWindow#handleSwitchTab()` to switch tab. Else, `MainWindow` does nothing.

The following activity diagram shows the flow of activites from when the `switch` command is executed.


image::SwitchActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Add command

// tag::editcommand[]
==== Edit command (Beatrice)
The edit feature allows users to edit the properties of a Recipe with ease using the `edit` command. +

This feature is facilitated by the `EditCommand` class. +

The following activity diagram illustrates how the `EditCommand` is used. +

.Activity Diagram for edit command
image::EditActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Implementation
This section explains how the `edit` command is implemented.

1. User specified arguments are passed to the `EditCommandParser` and passed into `ArgumentTokenizer` and
`ArgumentMultimap`.

2. The arguments will then be parsed by `ParserUtil` and passed into `EditRecipeDescriptor`.
An error will be thrown if the inputs were invalid or if no properties of the Recipe were edited.

3. A new `EditCommand` object will be created containing the new properties of the `Recipe`.

4. `EditCommand#execute()` will then get the latest list of recipes from `Model` and obtain the `Recipe` that is
being edited.

5. This `Recipe` is passed into `EditCommand#createEditedRecipe()` which creates a new `Recipe` with the edited properties.

6. `Model#setRecipe()` will then replace the `Recipe` being edited with the new `Recipe` and update the list of recipes and plans.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the steps taken so far:

.Edit sequence diagram
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The lifeline for EditCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[WARNING]
The details of some methods, like the the usage of `EditRecipeDecriptor`, was omitted to reduce clutter in the diagram.

The edited recipe will be updated in both the list of recipes and plans.
The following section explains in detail the implementation behind how each list is updated in the
`RecipeBook` and `PlannedBook` class.

1. Continuing off from Step 8, `ModelManager#setRecipe()` will be called to replace the target `Recipe` with the
edited `Recipe`. (`ModelManager` implements `Model`)

2. The target and edited `Recipe` is passed into `RecipeBook#setRecipe()` and `UniqueRecipeList#setRecipe()`, which
will replace the target with the edited `Recipe` in the recipe list.

3. The same arguments are then passed into `PlannedBook#setRecipe()` which will get a list of all the plans that uses
the target `Recipe` from `PlannedRecipeMap` and update each plan.


The following sequence diagram summarizes how the `Recipe` and all its related `Plan` are updated
when the `Recipe` is edited.

.Edit sequence diagram focusing on Model
image::EditModelSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How recipes are edited

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `EditRecipeDescriptor` class is used to make sense of user input and mimics
the `Recipe` class with the same properties.
** Pros: Multiple fields can be edited in one go.
** Cons: Might make testing harder since there are many properties in a Recipe and an edit command can take on any
combination of each property.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow each property in the `Recipe` to have its own `edit` command.
** Pros: Implementation of each command will be simpler.
** Cons: Editing a recipe will be harder and more troublesome for the user.

We decided to stick with alternative 1, which is the implementation inherited by AB3, as we believe that being able
to edit multiple fields in one go provides much more versatility and convenience to the user. Additionally, although
there are many properties to test, it is still a finite number and testing can be done with adequate time.

====== Aspect: Data structure to support the recipes and plans

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The recipes and plans are maintained in an `ObservableList` by the
`UniqueRecipeList` and `UniquePlannedList` class respectively. The lists are unmodifiable outside of these classes.
`PlannedRecipeMap` maintains the mapping from `Recipe` to all plans that use this `Recipe`.
** Pros: The `ObservableList` allows the UI to 'listen' in and be updated when the lists change. +
The unmodifiable property also safeguards the data in the lists from being corrupted. +
The `PlannedRecipeMap` eases the cost of iterating through the entire list of plans in the `UniquePlannedList` and
checking whether each plan uses the `Recipe` being edited.
** Cons: Performance might not be optimised by using a List instead of other data structures like a LinkedList or
HashMap for the `UniqueRecipeList` and `UniquePlannedList`.

* **Alternative 2:** Maintain the recipes and plans in an `ObservableMap` instead.
** Pros: Performance will be better by using a Map than a List.
** Cons: There are no official javafx classes that supports an sorted `ObservableMap` or a filtered `ObservableMap`.
We will have to write and maintain our own implementation or import from pre-existing libraries.

We decided to use alternative 1, as the cons of alternative 2 are too heavy. Many aspects of our program require
filtering and sorting to be supported. For example, plans need to be sorted in chronological order, and the advanced
recipe list needs to be filtered for our filter feature. +
Additionally, we would not have enough time in the scope of this project to write our own implementation, and importing from pre-existing
libraries gives the risk of running into bugs in the future if the the dependencies were not maintained.
// end::editcommand[]


==== Delete command

// tag::favouriteunfavourite[]
==== Favourite and Unfavourite commands (Brian)
===== Implementation
For brevity, we will only talk about the `favourite` command. Note that the `unfavourite` command is implemented in the
same way.

1. The user input received by `FavouriteCommandParser#parse` will pass on the user input to
`ParserUtil#parseMultipleIndex` to verify if the indexes keyed in are non-zero, unsigned integers. An error is thrown
if any of the indexes do not meet this requirement.
+
On top of verifying the validity of the indexes, `ParserUtil#parseMultipleIndex` will remove any duplicate indexes
and sort them. It returns a sorted array of one-based indexes.

2. A new `FavouriteCommand` object will be created with the array of indexes and returned to the `LogicManager`.

3. The `FavouriteCommand#execute` method is executed. First, the array of indexes will be checked against the
_currently displayed recipe list_ to ensure that there exists a corresponding recipe index. An error will be thrown if
a user specified recipe index is out of bounds.

4. Next, we check if the specified recipe(s) is already a favourite. If it is not a favourite yet, we use an
`EditRecipeDescriptor` to set the recipe's `isFavourite` to true.

5. Finally, we display the names of the recipes that have been newly made favourites, and the names of the recipes that
were already favourites.

Here is a sample sequence diagram that shows what happens when the user inputs `favourite 3`:

.Favourite command sequence diagram
image::FavouriteCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

This operation favourites recipe 2 and 3.
// end::favouriteunfavourite[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undo and Redo commands (Brian)
The implementation of undo and redo was adapted from AB3. However, HYBB requires more book-keeping because on top
of the `RecipeBook`, we have a `PlannedBook` and a `CookedRecordBook` to keep track of as well.

For brevity, we will only talk about the `undo` command. Note that the `redo` command is implemented in the same way.

===== Implementation (before undo is called)
1. Whenever a command that changes the state of any of the books (RecipeBook, PlannedBook, or CookedRecordBook) is
called, `Model#commitBook` is called as well.

2. `Model#commitBook` will first purge all redundant states in `MultipleBookStateManager` (ie. if the user called undo
before and is now committing a new book, he will not be able to redo the actions of those undos anymore). This is the
behavior that most modern desktop applications like Microsoft Word adopt.

3. `Model#commitBook` also saves the `CommandType` and `Tab` of the command in 2 separate stacks in
`MultipleBookStateManager`. Finally, it saves the new state of the affected book(s) in an ArrayList of that book type.

Note #1: `CommandType` tells you which book(s) the command affects, while `Tab` tells you which tab should be
displayed upon execution of the command.

Note #2: All 3 ArrayLists of the 3 book types have a "current pointer" each, which points to the respective states of
the books that the `Model` is currently using (ie. what the user is seeing).

The following diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a command that changes the state of any book:

.Activity diagram when a command is executed
image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Implementation (when undo is called)
1. `Model#canUndo` is called to check if there are sufficient actions to be undone. An error is thrown if there are
insufficient actions to be undone.

2. If able to undo, `Model#undoBook` is called. The `CommandType` stack is popped to know which book(s) need undoing.
At the same time, the "current pointer" of the corresponding book ArrayList(s) is/are shifted backwards. All 3 books
in `Model` are then set to the version of the book that each "current pointer" is pointing to.

This class diagram shows the components of `MultipleBookStateManager`:

.Class diagram for MultipleBookStateManager
image::MultipleBookStateManagerClassDiagram.png[]


The following diagrams show what happens after the execution of various commands:

.When the app is first opened
image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

.When "delete 5" is called, the state of RecipeBook is changed. This new state is added to ArrayList<RecipeBook>.
image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

.When "favourite 3" is called, the state of RecipeBook is changed. This new state is added to ArrayList<RecipeBook>.
image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

.When "undo" is called, the current state pointer of ArrayList<RecipeBook> is shifted back and the Model's RecipeBook is set to this version.
image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

.When a command like "list" (that does not change the state of any book) is called, the current state pointer remains where it is (ie. there is no change of states).
image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

.If a command like "clear" (that changes the state of a book) is called while the current pointer is not pointing to the latest version, all versions after the current pointer will be purged and the newest version will be added to the ArrayList.
image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: How undo and redo executes
One concern we had while choosing the design of the undo and redo features was the amount of memory that has to be used
to keep track of the different states of the 3 books.

On top of the ArrayLists of different book types, we also needed to have 2 additional stacks to keep track of the
corresponding `CommandType` and `Tab`.

We eventually decided on the current implementation because we do not expect the user to make that many changes to the
books in a single session. We also do not expect the size of any book to grow so huge that a single commit would take
up all the memory capacity. In other words, we foresee that the "cons" of our current choice will not happen (it would
take really abnormal user behavior for it to reach that stage).

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire recipe book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May use up a lot of memory space within a single session 1) if there is a large number of book commits
and/or 2) if the magnitude of a single commit is large (ie. the book being committed is huge just by itself).

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory.
** Cons: Tedious to ensure the correctness of the implementation of each individual command. Furthermore, some commands
affect multiple books, making book-keeping even more complicated (and hence, susceptible to error).

===== Future plans
Currently, the undo and redo command is not compatible with the `quote` command and the QuoteBook. This will be a
feature that we plan to work on beyond v1.4 so that users will be able to undo and redo the action of adding a quote!
// end::undoredo[]

==== Clear command


==== Exit command


// end::basic[]

// tag::recipecustomisation[]
=== Recipe customisation commands (Brian)
The following commands: `addingredient`, `editingredient`, `deleteingredient`, `addstep`, `editstep`, and `deletestep`
were implemented to overcome the limitations of the `edit` command. These recipe customisation commands allow the user
to make targeted changes to the ingredient or step fields instead of having to rewrite the entire field using `edit`.

==== Implementation
1. The commands listed above make use of `EditRecipeDescriptor` (ERD) to add, edit, or delete ingredients or steps.
This is done by comparing the contents of the ERD to the contents of the field to be edited and making the necessary
changes described below (note that at this point of time, the ERD is already populated with the user's input):

* If the command is `addingredient` or `addstep`, the existing ingredients or steps from the recipe will be added to
the ERD.

* If the command is `editingredient` or `editstep`, the ERD will be checked against the recipe to see if the
ingredients or step exists in the recipe. If it exists, the remaining ingredients or steps that were not changed
will be added to the ERD. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

* If the command is `deleteingredient` or `deletestep`, the ERD will be checked against the recipe to see if the
ingredients or step exists in the recipe. If it exists, the ERD will be re-populated with the existing ingredients or
steps from the recipe, less the ones that were specified by the user. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

2. With the ERD fields set, the specified recipe is edited by `EditCommand#createEditedRecipe` using the ERD.

3. Finally, `Model#setRecipe` will replace the old version of the recipe in RecipeBook with the newly edited one.
`Model#commitBook` will commit the new state of the RecipeBook to the `MultipleBookStateManager` so that the user will
be able to undo this command if he wishes to.

.General activity diagram for recipe customisation commands
image::RecipeCustomisationCommandsActivityDiagram.png[]
//end::recipecustomisation[]

// tag::advancedfilter[]
=== Filter command (Brian)
The advanced filter feature uses the `filter` command to search for recipes according to the set of keywords provided
by the user. Think of it as a greatly enhanced and more robust version of the `find` command, which only allows the
user to find recipes by their name.

==== Implementation
This section explains how the `filter` command is implemented.

1. User specified keywords are directed to `FilterCommandParser#parse` where `ArgumentTokenizer` and
`ArgumentMultimap` are used to parse the user input. An exception will be thrown if no keywords are specified at all.

2. The parsed user input is then fed into `RecipeMatchesKeywordPredicate` where a `Predicate`, p, is created. This
predicate will subsequently be used as the filter to get all recipes that meet the user specified criteria.

3. A new `FilterCommand` object will be created with the predicate, p, and be returned to the `LogicManager`.

4. The `FilterCommand#execute` method is executed and `Model#updateFilteredRecipeList` is called. This tests
every recipe in the database against the predicate, p, and updates the filtered recipe list with recipes that meet the
user specified criteria.

5. Once complete, this filtered recipe list is displayed to the user.

Here is a sample sequence diagram that shows what happens when the user inputs `filter favourites t/20 ig/Pasta`:

.Advanced filter sequence diagram
image::AdvancedFilterSequenceDiagram.png[]


This operation displays all recipes that 1) are marked as favourites, 2) take 20 minutes or less to prepare,
and 3) contains pasta as an ingredient.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Consistency of user input format
One concern we had while implementing this feature was the sheer number of commands and prefixes that our app had.
Eventually, the current implementation was chosen because we didn't want to define a new format for `filter`
keywords which might potentially confuse our users.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the existing prefixes and format in the user input.
** Pros: The existing `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap` classes already have capabilities to parse user input
that is in a certain format. Thus, using the same format saves us time and effort in implementing our own parser. It
also spares the user from having to remember multiple formats / keywords.
** Cons: The user has to be familiar with the prefixes and other special keywords in order to use this feature to its
fullest potential.

* **Alternative 2:** Define new keywords that the user can use. These keywords could be "more english-like" as opposed
to using shortened tags as prefixes.
** Pros: Easy to remember these keywords since they are more english-like.
** Cons: We must implement our own parser which is tedious. The user will also have to remember a new set of keywords
on top of the existing prefixes. This is double work for the user.
// end::advancedfilter[]

// tag::planning[]
=== Add plan command (Beatrice)
==== Implementation
The planning feature uses the `UniquePlannedList` to store and display all plans and the `PlannedRecipeMap` to
navigate between recipes and plans.

The `UniquePlannedList` provides the UI with an unmodifiable observable list that can be 'observed' and displayed.
Meanwhile, the `PlannedRecipeMap` maintains a mapping from `Recipe` to `Plan` so that a `Plan` can be easily
updated when a `Recipe` is changed.

Given below is a sequence diagram on how a `Plan` is updated when a `Recipe` is changed.

image::abc.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How recipes are scheduled

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Scheduled recipes are saved in a separate data structure.
** Pros: Scheduled recipes can be easily obtained and sorted.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage if a large number of recipes are scheduled.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the date that the scheduled recipe is scheduled on as another attribute to the Recipe class.
** Pros: Easy to implement, no additional data structure added.
** Cons: All scheduled recipes can not be easily seen and sorted.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the scheduled recipes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a tree map to store the scheduled recipes in a <Date, List<Recipe>> key-value pair.
** Pros: Allows us to easily and intuitively access the list of recipes scheduled on a certain day.
** Cons: Obtaining all the recipes scheduled across a period of time will not be very efficient.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a List sorted by increasing time.
** Pros: Easy to implement, uncomplicated data structure.
** Cons: Hard to obtain the scheduled recipes on a certain date, as we do not know which index
corresponds to the date we are interested in.
// end::planning[]

// tag::goals[]
=== Goals feature (Harshita)
The main functionalities and commands associated with the entire goals feature are `add`, `addIngredient`, `edit`, `editIngredient`,
 `cooked`, `listGoals` and 'removeGoals'. Goals are auto-generated and added to a recipe every time `add`, `addIngredient`, `edit` or `editIngredient` is executed.

==== Details of Implementation (Auto-generation of goals)
The following sequence diagram shows how goals are generated through the example of `addIngredient` command execution

.Add command sequence diagram
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]
.Reference Frame for Add command sequence diagram
image::AddRefSequenceDiagram.png[]

A recipe is initially created with an empty goals set from parser and `calculateGoals()` is then called in the `AddCommand`.

Each ingredient type that is associated with a goal (`Vegetable`, `Protein`, `Fruit`, `Grain`) is listed as an enum type
in MainIngredientType. This ensures that invalid goals are not created and simplifies the mapping between `MainIngredientType`
and `Goal`.

The calculation of goals then occurs through looping through each ingredient type and executing the method call to
`Recipe#calculateIngredientQuantity()`.
This would obtain the total quantity for each ingredient, firstly by calling `Ingredient#getMainIngredientType()`
to ensure the validity of ingredients beings calculated (e.g. any instance of 'Other' ingredient would throw an `InvalidStateException`).
Secondly, by obtaining the quantity in grams through the method calls to `Ingredient#getQuantity()' and 'Quantity#convertToGram()`.

After the calculation for each main ingredient type is completed, an instance of `MainIngredientTypeMagnitude` is created.
It acts as a container to store the quantities and conduct the checks for whether these quantities meet the minimum quantity
requirement for their respective food group. This calculation and checks are done through the method call to
`MainIngredientTypeMagnitude#getMainTypes()` which would then return a set of `MainIngredientType` that successfully met the
minimum requirement.

Lastly, after looping through this set and creating each goal with the mapping from `MainIngredientType` to `Goal` done
(e.g. `MainIngredientType.FRUIT` leads to the creation of goal with goal name generated as "Fruity Fiesta"), the goals will
be updated in the particular instance of `Recipe r` and `Model#addRecipe(r)` would then update `RecipeBook` in storage.

The immutability of each object is supported to ensure the correctness of undo and redo functionality.

==== Details of Implementation (Statistics of cooked recipes)

.Activity diagram when a cooked command is entered
image::CookedActivityDiagram.png[]

After `CookedCommand#execute(model)` is called, the series of checks shown in the above diagram is done to determine
if the recipe can be marked as cooked. With multiple recipes inputted (eg "`cooked` 1 2 3", the series of checks will
loop through for for each recipe.

The checks ensure that all the recipes inputted are valid, else the  `CookedCommand`
throws an exception and terminates. If successful, a new  `Record` containing the `Name`, current `Date` and set of `Goals`
associated with the recipe is created and `Model#addRecord(record)` would then update `CookedRecordBook` in storage.

Furthermore, if the recipe marked as cooked was included in the Planned Recipes for the day,
it will be removed from the planned list.

With reference to the structure of the CookedRecords Model,
.Class diagram of Record
image::ModelRecordClassDiagram.png[]

We can see above that once a record is added to the UniqueRecordList two Observable lists will be updated for each
addition of `Record`. Firstly, it is the `internalRecordsList` that stores unique `Record`. Secondly, based on this list,
an `internalGoalsTally` that stores `GoalCount` will be updated each time. This `GoalCount` consists of one of the four main goal
and its respective tally and this observable list is what the pie chart will be listening to for updates and will change
each time the `internalGoalsTally` has been updated as well.

Hence the `cooked` command is essential in not only archiving data, but also giving the user personalised statistics
on their overall goal distribution that resembles the Healthy Eating Plate. The immutability of each object is
supported to ensure the correctness of undo and redo functionality as well.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How goals are being tagged

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** System generates tags for each recipe based on food algorithm.
** Pros: Higher accuracy and makes use of inputs of ingredients class.
** Cons: Would require several criteria checks that may not be intuitive and would require the use of artificial intelligence for the highest accuracy.

* **Alternative 2 :** User chooses from 4 given goals and user adds the tags to the recipes.
** Pros: Easy to implement. User can filter their preferred goals easily.
** Cons: Is dependant on user's understanding and not universal understanding of what may be deemed healthy.

Alternative 1 was chosen as standardising the goals give the recipes more meaning, especially when we are able
to calculate statistics and present in in an meaningful and appealing way for users when it models the Healthy eating Plate.
Furthermore, custom goals would not have checks would not have been implemented. for users to filter preferred recipes,
the command `favourite` as been implemented.

===== Aspect: How to determine the criteria for each goal

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check by quantity
** Pros: More accurate and can be modelled against ideal ratio of a healthy meal.
** Cons: Harder to implement as we need to standardise the ingredient measurements, not as intuitive.

* **Alternative 2 :** Check by variety
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not as accurate as one grain of rice or 1 grape would still be counted as variety despite the small portion.

Alternative 1 was chosen because of its higher accuracy, although conversion between different measurement may be
overestimated. The command `deleteGoal` was then created in order to enable users to delete goals they deem inaccurate.

===== Aspect: How the check for goal is done

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check every time a recipe is added or edited and store this data
** Pros: More consistent for the user in keeping track of their goals.
** Cons: Harder to implement as repetitive checks are needed every time ingredients are added or modified.
Will be more expensive to calculate with a larger database.

* **Alternative 2 :** Calculate the goals for each recipe every time it is retrieved from storage and set in RecipeList.
** Pros: Easier to implement as only one check is needed for when the recipes are set.
** Cons: Goals will reset each time the application is open. If goal has been deleted by user with `deleteGoal`, it will
not be updated the next time the user opens the application as the checks will be the same.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it optimizes the function of deleteGoal`, taking user preference into consideration.

===== Aspect: How to store data for records

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store in a json file called records and calculate goal tally the first time
it is set and update accordingly
** Pros: A custom date can be set and it will be easier to iterate through the list to obtain goal tally.
** Cons: Duplicate data will be stored and is harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2 :** Use recipebook and add boolean attribute isCooked
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Restricted usage, unable to implement date and do statistical analysis for the user.

* **Alternative 3 :** Store goal tally in a new json file.
** Pros: No need to iterate through recipe list each time and would be less expensive with a larger database.
** Cons: Only contains four values.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it optimizes the functions and uses of a Record and the scale for a personal data
base is smaller, storage would not be an issue. Records need to be iterated through when set initially anyway, hence
the association between GoalCount and Record makes the tally process more efficient.

=== Quote Command (Yue Tong)
The quote command feature uses the `quote` command for users to input their own quotes to add on to the existing set of
quotes that is already in the database. This allows the users to add in customised quotes that would suit their preferance
more if the current list of quotes is not to their liking.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `QuoteCommand` is used.

.Quote command sequence diagram
image::QuoteSequenceDiagram.png[]
[NOTE]
The lifeline for EditCommandParser should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML,
the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[Note]
`Undo` button currently does not work for adding of quotes as there is no remove function currently implemented for quote
==== Implementation

This section explains how the `quote` command is implemented.

1. User specified arguments are passed to the `QuoteCommandParser#parse` which will then parse the user input to verify if the
quote field is empty. An error is thrown if the user had keyed in an empty field for quote.

2. A new `QuoteCommand` object will be created with a `Content` field to store the quote and returned to the `LogicManager`

3. The `QuoteCommand#execute` method is executed and `Model#addQuote` is called. This attempts to add the quote to the
database and verify if any duplicate quote exists in the database via `Model#hasQuote`. If a duplicate quote is detected
in the database, an error will be thrown to indicate that the quote already exists in the database.

4. Once the quote has been successfully updated to the database, the result window informs the user that the quote has
been successfully added.

The following activity diagram further illustrates how the `QuoteCommand` is used.

.Quote command activity diagram
image::QuoteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: How quote command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `QuoteCommand` only accepts adding of quotes

** Pros: Maintaining the database for quotes is easier
** Cons: Users will not be able to remove a quote if it is not to their liking and undo function does not work for quote command

* **Alternative 2:** The `QuoteCommand` accepts both adding and removal of quotes
** Pros: Users can customize whicher quotes they want to be displayed
** Cons: If they user deletes the quote that is on display for Quote of the Day in the Achievement tab, this could cause
display problems and as `UniqueQuotesList` is a hidden list, users will have to type out the quote completely similar in order to locate it

=== Streak feature(Yue Tong)

The Streak feature mainly deals with keeping track of the cooked meals that the user has logged into the system. The command
that Streak is associated with is `CookedCommand` as every user input of `cooked` will result in the streak log  to be reflected when `cooked` is executed. The changes are reflected in two main attributes, Current streak and
High streak.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `QuoteCommand` is used.

.Quote command sequence diagram
image::StreakActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation

The streak feature uses data from the `UniqueRecordList` to parse through the recipes that the user has already cooked
and extract the dates from these recipes to determine the current streak for the user and the highest streak score the
user has attained as of yet.

The `UniqueRecordList` provides Streak with an observableList so that a listener could be added to it to make sure that
the streak always auto-updates whenever a new `CookedRecord` is added in to the database. Via the addListener, whenever
a new record is detected, the streaks are calculated again through parsing of the `CookedRecords` list and updated in
real time in the achievement tab.

==== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: How streak is stored

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Streak is calculated and updated via access to `UniqueRecordList`

** Pros: Easier to access `CookedRecord` list when there is direct access to `UniqueRecordList` and to update in real time
** Cons: There is more co-dependency among classes and there may be performance issues if `UniqueRecordList` is too large

* **Alternative 2:** Streak has its own database and json file to keep track of streaks
** Pros: Lesser time is required to re-calculate streaks every time a cookedRecord is updated as streak can just be
added and subtracted from its recorded data in the database
** Cons: A database section will be dedicated to just storing one number and without access to the `UniqueRecordsList`
it is harder for Streak to be updated realtime when cookedRecord is updated.

====== Aspect: How streak is calculated

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accumulative streaks is calculated based on whether there is a 1-day difference
between 2 consecutive cooked recipes

** Pros: Easier to compute compared to implementing via a midnight deadline basis to calculate accumulative streaks
** Cons: Streaks are not necessarily accounted for within a 24-hour period

* **Alternative 2:** Accumulative streaks is calculated based on a stricter within 24-hour new logged cooked recipes
** Pros: The accountability is higher for users to actually accomplish their streaks by having to cook recipes within a
24-hour period and not be able to go for more than a day without cooking new recipes without having their streaks
jeopardised.
** Cons: It is easier for users to lose their streaks and more difficult for users to ascertain when is the deadline to
maintain their streaks

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
