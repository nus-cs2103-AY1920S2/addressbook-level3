== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PomodoroDisplay`, `StatisticsDisplay`, `PetDisplay` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TaskListParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user or highlighting the text input field with a certain color.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1, 2")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1, 2` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task List, Pet, Pomodoro and statistics data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task List data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pet data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pomodoro data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Statistics data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// // tag::undoredo[ ]
// === [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
// ==== Proposed Implementation

// The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
// It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
// Additionally, it implements the following operations:

// * `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
// * `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
// * `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

// These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

// Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

// Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

// image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

// Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

// image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

// Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

// image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

// [NOTE]
// If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

// Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

// image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

// [NOTE]
// If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

// The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

// image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

// NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

// The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

// [NOTE]
// If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

// Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

// image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

// Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

// image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

// The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

// image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

// ==== Design Considerations

// ===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

// * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
// ** Pros: Easy to implement.
// ** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
// * **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
// ** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
// ** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

// ===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

// * **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
// ** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
// ** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
// * **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
// ** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
// ** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// === [Proposed] Data Encryption

// _{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// // end::dataencryption[]

=== Sorting

.Sequence of executing a sort command
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommand.java[`SortCommand.java`]

==== Implementation
The tasklist has no default sorting set on it. It will only be sorted when the sort command is used like so `sort {field1}, {field2}, ...`.
First our Model accepts an array of Comparators which it will iterate through from the back to ensure that the first comparator is the highest sort order.

To implement this, we've augmented the UniqueTaskList and TaskList with a function setComparator. This allows us to set several comparators on the taskList to perform multi level sorting while maintaing the ObservableList which JavaFX can then use to update the UI.

=== AutoComplete

.Activity diagram of auto complete
image::AutoCompleteActivityDiagram.png[]

[[Pomodoro]]
=== Pomodoro
Pomodoro is activated by the `pom` command. It follows the same execution flow as many of the other commands in BBProductive.

.Interactions Inside Logic Component for the pom 1 command
image::PomSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Implementation
Pomosoero's features are implemented mainly in `seedu.address.logic` package. The `PomodoroManager` class is used to maniulate the timer and configure the relevant UI elements. The timer is facilitated by `javafx.animation.Timeline`.

Through the use of the Pomodoro feature, there are occasions where the app has to prompt the user for specific input in order to progress. This behaviour flow is represented in the _Pomodoro Acctivity_ diagram.

.Pomodoro Activity Diagram
image::PomodoroActivityDiagram.png[width=400]

The `PomodoroManager` maintains a  `prompt_state` indicating what the app might be prompting the user at a given time.

*Pomodoro Prompt States*

* `NONE`: There is no particular prompt happening. The default state when the app is in the neutral state. (i.e. No pomodoro running.)
* `CHECK_DONE`: This state occurs when a timer expires during a Pomodoro cycle.
* `CHECK_TAKE_BREAK`: This state occurs after user response has been received in the CHECK_DONE state.
* `CHECK_DONE_MIDPOM`: This state occurs when the user calls done on a task that is the Pomodoro running task.

Pomodoro has settings that can be configured by the user:

* Pomodoro Time: This defines how long the Pomodoro work period is. The default is 25 minutes.
* Break Time: This defines how long the breaks last in between Pomodoro periods. The default is 5 minutes.

This data is captured and stored in the `Pomodoro` class in `seedu.address.model`, which interacts with the app’s storage system. `PomodoroManager` also updates the `Pomodoro` model on what task is being run and the time remaining in a particular cycle. This allows the time progress to be persistent in between app closures and relaunches.

=== Reminders
The user's reminder functionality is achieved by calculating the time delay from the current time and the time from the user input. This time delay as well as the Task name and description is passed to the MainWindow for the reminder to be triggered as a pop up at the right time.

==== Implementation
A `DateTimeFormatter` is used to parse the date time from the user input, which is just the date in the r/ flag when adding or editing a task, into a `LocalDateTime` object. This `LocalDateTime` is used to store the date and time information. When the reminder is instantiated, a `setDelay` method is called setting in motion the calculation of time delay between the current time and the reminder time, and triggering of reminder on the `MainWindow`. The reminder class is stored as an `Optional` in the Task class itself.

Reminder is stored as a string in the `JsonAdaptedTask`. This string contains the exact format of the date and time that the user inputs, this allows the same constructor to be used when the data is read and changed to a task and thus reminder object. A sequence diagram of the reminder flow is shown below for reference.

.Reminder Sequence Diagram
image::ReminderSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]


=== Recurring
The user's recurring tasks functionality is twofold. Resetting the task to be unfinished after the stipulated time interval and resetting the task's reminder date according to the stipulated time interval. The behaviour for this recurring feature is mainly represented in the activity diagram below.

.Recurring Activity Diagram
image::RecurringActivityDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Implementation
The logic is mainly implemented in the `Recurring` class and `ModelManager` class in `seedu.address.model`, which interacts with the app’s storage system especially with respect to task storage. This `Recurring` instance is stored in `Task` as an optional field.

In the `Recurring` class, whenever a task is added or edited, the recurring type is then parsed to be either daily or weekly. Afterward, based on the time the recurring attribute is added, a reference LocalDateTime is noted in the `Recurring` instance itself. This ensures that the first recurring behaviour will trigger in the given interval with respect to that referenceDateTime and following the same interval afterwards.

The recurring behaviour is orchestrated in `ModelManager` whenever a task is added or edited, a `setTask` method is called that will generate a `Timer` and `TimerTask`. A `TimerTask` is the logic run to update the task, namely resetting the done and the reminder accordingly. The `Timer` schedules `TimerTasks` at a fixed rate based on the the time interval chosen, if it is daily it will be every 24 hours (but for testing purposes it will be every 60 seconds) and if it is weekly it will be every 7 days. There is only 1 `Timer` for the `ModelManager` that handles the scheduling of each `TimerTask` that corresponds to every task that has a recurring behaviour. On boot the `Timer` is canceled and replaced with a new instance, subsequently all the tasks are iterated through. Every task with a recurring attribute will have a `TimerTask` generated and scheduled accordingly.

The recurring behaviour triggered will set the task as undone. If a reminder exists and has been triggered, it will increment the reminder to be the next day or week depending on the interval set. When the recurring behaviour is triggered, the result display will show a message that the recurring task has been reset.

Additionally, a flag has been made to check if the task needs to be changed, if it does not it will not be unnecessarily updated in the `Model`. A class diagram of the tasks and all its attributes is shown below.

Recurring is stored as a string in the `JsonAdaptedTask`. This string contains the LocalDateTime information for the reference date as well as the type of interval itself. A special constructor for this string is used to reconstruct the recurring attribute when reading from storage.



.Task Class Diagram with all aforementioned attributes including recurring and reminder
image::TaskClassDiagram.png[width=790]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of tasks
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* need motivation to get things done

*Value proposition*: We integrate a Pomodoro-Pet environment into a full fledged task manager. The pet system serves to gamify the act of doing tasks, thereby motivating users, and the Pomodoro helps users get into a regular work/rest cycle. This integrationcovers all aspects of productivity in line platform. It covers motivation, organising of tasks and also how to go about doing them. This all in one solution is seldom found in other applications which implement maybe 1 or 2 of these features.

=== Viewing Relevant Screens on command

. On launch
.. Upon double clicking the JAR file, a GUI with the tasks list on the right panel appears.

. On typing stats
.. Type stats in the input command box if you are in either the tasks or settings panel.
... Expected: The right panel shows a GUI with multiple graphs.

. On typing settings
.. Type settings in the input command box if you are in either the tasks or statistics panel.
... Expected: The right panel shows a GUI with multiple fields for the settings.

. On typing tasks
.. Type tasks in the input command box if you are in either the settings or statistics panel.
... Expected: The right panel shows a GUI with the task list.

=== Adding a task
. Adding from a screen with 0 tasks
.. First run `clear` to clear all tasks if there are still tasks on the screen.
.. Add a task by running the command `add n/test1` +
Expected: A task card appears in the tasklist with the name test1.

. Adding from a screen with 1 task
.. Add another task by running the command `add n/test2` +
Expected: A task card appears in the tasklist with the name test2.

=== Editing a task
+ Prerequisite : Run `clear` and add a task using the command `add n/editTest`

. Editing a task's name
.. Run the command `edit 1 n/editedTest`. +
Expected: The command will result in the first task card's name to change from editTest to editedTest.

. Editing a task's description
.. Run the command `edit 1 des/testDescription`. +
Expected: The command will result in the testDescription being the description of the task card.

. Editing a task's priority
.. Run the command `edit 1 p/2`. +
Expected: The command will result in the priority to change from low to medium on the task card.

. Editing a task's tags
.. Run the command `edit 1 t/test`. +
Expected: The command will result in the test tag to appear below the task name on the task card.

=== Adding and triggering a reminder for the task
. Adding a task with a reminder. +
Prerequisite: Take note of the current time plus 1 minute and date in the format `DD/MM/YY@HH:mm`, for example if the current time is `15/03/20@15:47` then you should get the command ready `15/03/20@15:48` (but use the current date and time instead)
.. Run the command `add n/reminderTest des/test r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` +
Expected: When the time has arrived a a pop up with a title `reminderTest` and description `test` appears.

. Editing a task to have a reminder. +
Prerequisite: Take note of the current time plus 1 minute and date in the format `DD/MM/YY@HH:mm`, for example if the current time is `15/03/20@15:47` then you should get the command ready `15/03/20@15:48` (but use the current date and time instead)
.. Add a task `add n/editReminderTest des/test` first and see it added on the tasklist panel
.. Take note of the index of that task
.. Edit the task with `edit <index> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` +
Expected: The task displays the reminder date in the task card. When the time comes, a pop up with a title `editReminderTest` and description `test` appears.


=== Adding a recurring attribute to a task
. Adding a task with a recurring attribute. +
.. Run the command `add n/recurTest rec/d`
.. Take note of the index of that task.
.. Run the done command `done <index>` +
Expected: Although it is meant to be a daily recurring task and thus the time delay should be 24 hours, for testing purposes the time delay is set to 60 seconds. After 60 seconds, the done is set back to unfinished, with the tick being removed from the task card.

. Editing a task to have a recurring attribute. +
.. Add a task `add n/editRecurringTest` firs and see it added on the tasklist panel
.. Take note of the index of that task
.. Edit the task with `edit <index> rec/d`
.. Run the done command `done <index>` +
Expected: The task is marked as done at first. After 60 seconds, the done is set back to unfinished, with the tick being removed from the task card.

. Adding a task with a reminder and recurring attribute. +
Prerequisite: Take note of the current time plus 1 minute and date in the format `DD/MM/YY@HH:mm`, for example if the current time is `15/03/20@15:47` then you should get the command ready `15/03/20@15:48` (but use the current date and time instead)
.. Run the command `add n/recurReminderTest r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm rec/d`
.. Take note of the index of that task.
.. Run the done command `done <index>` +
Expected: After 60 seconds, the done is set back to unfinished, with the tick being removed from the task card. After the reminder appears, the date displayed changes to the next day, for example `15 March at 15:48` changes to `16 March at 15:48`.
