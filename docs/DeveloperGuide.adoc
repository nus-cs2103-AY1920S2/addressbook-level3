== About Us
Delino is for couriers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their delivery tasks*.
It is *optimised for those who have a strong preference towards Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still enjoying the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Delino is adapted from the https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/[AddressBook-Level3] project created by
https://se-education.org[SE-EDU initiative].

If you wish to contact the team, more details can be found <<AboutUs#, here>>.

== How to navigate this Developer Guide
This developer guide is written for anyone who wish to extend/modify Delino.
This guide will first touch on the overview of our application in the <<Design-Architecture, design architecture>>.
Secondly, the specific implementation of Delino's commands will be further elaborated in the
<<implementation, implementation>> section.

If you need help setting up your development environment to work on Delino, you can follow the
<<SettingUp#, Setting Up>> guide.

Manual testing of Delino can be done by following <<manual-testing, Appendix G: Instructions for Manual Testing>>.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.svg[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/delino/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/delino/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -o 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete -o 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/delino/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a *MainWindow* that is made up of parts e.g.*CommandBox*, *ResultDisplay*, *PersonListPanel* etc. All these, including the *MainWindow*, inherit from the abstract *UiPart* class.

The *UI* component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/delino/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified
in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The *UI* component,

* Executes user commands using the *Logic* component.
* Listens for changes to *Model* data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/delino/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  *Logic* uses the *DelinoParser* class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a *Command* object which is executed by the *LogicManager*.
.  The command execution can affect the *Model* (e.g. adding a new order).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a *CommandResult* object which is passed back to the *Ui*.
.  In addition, the *CommandResult* object can also instruct the *Ui* to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the *Logic* component for the `execute("delete -o 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -o 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.svg[]

NOTE: The lifeline for *DeleteCommandParser* should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

//tag::design_model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/delino/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The *Model*,

* stores a *UserPref* object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Order Book and Return Order Book data.
* exposes two unmodifiable lists, the `ObservableList<ReturnOrder>` and `ObservableList<Order>` that can be
'observed'. +
 e.g. The UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
An *Order* class consists of ten different fields as shown in the image.
Every order is part of a *UniqueOrderList* and
every *UniqueOrderList* is part of an *OrderBook*. +
Similarly, a *ReturnOrder* class consists of nine different fields as shown in the image.
Every return order is part of a *UniqueReturnOrderList* and every
*UniqueReturnOrderList* is part of a *ReturnOrderBook*.
//end::design_model[]

//tag::Design-Storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-1/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/delino/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The *Storage* component,

* can save *UserPref* objects in json format and read it back.
* can save both *OrderBook* and *ReturnOrderBook* data in json format and read it back.
//end::Design-Storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.delino.commons` package.

[[implementation]]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//@@author Amoscheong97
//tag::insert[]
[[insert]]
=== Insert Feature
This section, will <<what-is-insert, introduce>> the `insert` feature.
In addition, it will show the expected <<insert-sequence, path-execution>>,
the <<insert-class, structure>> of the of the *InsertCommand* class,
<<insertparser-class, structure>> of the *InsertCommandParser* class and
it will also describe the <<insert-sequence, interaction>> of objects between the *InsertCommand* object
and other object classes.

[[what-is-insert]]
==== What is the Insert feature
The `insert` feature allows the user to insert an incoming delivery order into the list using the command line. +

The order consists of : Transaction ID, Name, Phone, Address, Email, Delivery Timestamp, Warehouse location,
CashOnDelivery

The order also consists of two optional fields that can be added:

. Type of Item

. Comment for Courier

[[insert-class]]
==== Structure of Insert feature

The following diagrams shows the overview of the *InsertCommand* Class Diagram: +

.Insert Class Diagram
image::InsertClassDiagram.svg[]

The above class diagram shows the structure of the *InsertCommand*
and its associated classes and interfaces. Some methods and fields are not included because they are
not extensively utilised in *InsertCommand*; such as public static fields and getter/setter methods.

[[insertparser-class]]
==== Structure of InsertCommandParser
.InsertCommandParser Class Diagram
image::InsertParserClassDiagram.svg[]

The above class diagram shows the structure of the *InsertCommandParser*
and its associated classes and interfaces. It describes all the class dependencies of the *InsertCommandParser*
class. Some methods and fields are not included because they are
not extensively utilised in *InsertCommand*; such as public static fields and getter/setter methods.
As shown in the diagram above, the *InsertCommandParser* make use of methods from classes such as using the
getValue method from the *ArgumentMultimap* class.

[[insert-activity]]
==== Path Execution of Insert Command

The overview of the *InsertCommand* Activity Diagram is shown below: +

.Insert Activity Diagram
image::InsertActivityDiagram.svg[]

After the user calls the `insert` command, the code will check if the command has all the compulsory prefixes present.
The code will throw a *ParseException* when there are missing prefixes. After that is checked, it will check if the
new order added is a duplicate (The Order is already inserted into the application). It will throw a *CommandException*
when the user tries to insert a duplicate order. Otherwise, it will insert the order and prints a success message to
the user.

[[insert-sequence]]
==== Interaction between objects when the *Insert Command* is executed
Here is the sequence diagram for the *Insert Command* as shown below: +

.Insert
image::InsertCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments of the `insert` command will be parsed using the parse method of the *InsertCommandParser* class. +
The *InsertCommandParser* will tokenize the arguments parsed in using the tokenize method of
*ArgumentTokenizer* class which returns the tokenized arguments.
Using the tokenized arguments, the Parser will check if the arguments parsed in matches with the
tokenized arguments using the arePrefixesPresent method.

There are two scenarios : +

. Some compulsory prefixes are not present : +
*InsertCommandParser* will throw a new *ParseException* object to the *LogicManager*.

. All compulsory prefixes are present in the arguments : +
It will the  proceed to use the getValue method of the *ArgumentMultimap* class to get the value of the prefix.
For example, if the argument parsed in is tid/A12345, the getValue method will get the
value 'A12345'. Subsequently, it will use the *ParseUtil* methods to get the corresponding object
values and put it into the parameters of the new *Order* object.
The order object will be put into the parameter of the *InsertCommand* object and this will be returned
to the *LogicManager* class for execution.

*LogicManager* will call the execute() method of this *InsertCommand* object.
In the execute() method, it will use the *Model* class to call hasOrder method to check
for duplicates, if it is a duplicate, the order will throw a *CommandException* which
indicates that there is a duplicate order in the *OrderBook* already.
Else, it will successfully inserts the new order
using addOrder method. Finally, it return a new *CommandResult* object,
containing a String that indicates a successful insertion.

//tag::list[]
[[list]]
=== List feature
This section describes the <<list-functionality, functionality>> , the <<list-structure, structure>>,
<<list-interactions, interactions>> between objects and <<list-path, path>> the path execution
of the `list` command.

[[list-functionality]]
==== What is the List feature
List feature allows the user to see all the orders from both Delivery Orders and Return Orders.

The user can enter `list` to display all the orders. Besides that, the user can also input `done` to display
all delivered orders and `undone` to display all orders that are not delivered.

[[list-structure]]
==== Structure List feature
The structure of the List Feature is as shown below:

.List Class Diagram
image::ListClassDiagram.svg[]

The above class diagram shows the structure of the *ListCommand* and all its associated classes and interfaces.
The *ListCommand* has dependencies on the *Model* class as it uses the two methods from it : +

* updateFilteredOrderList

* updateReturnFilteredOrderList

There are other variables and strings not shown in this Class Diagrams as they are either static methods or variables.

[[list-path]]
==== Path execution of the List Command
.List Activity Diagram
image::ListActivityDiagram.svg[]

The above activity diagram shows the logic and the path execution when the `list` command is executed.
There are only three correct syntax available for `ListCommand`: +

* `list`

* `list` `done`

* `list` `undone`

The code will check if the input is one of the three mentioned above. If the input is not one of the three, it will
cause the code the throw an error message to the user.

[[list-interactions]]
==== Interaction between objects during execution of List Command
The sequence diagram for the `list` command is shown below: +

.List Command Sequence Diagram
image::ListCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The user first calls the command `list`.
[NOTE]
====
The second argument of the `list` command can be `done` or `undone` or an empty String.
====

The LogicManager will call the parseCommand method of *DelinoParser*, which then passes the second argument
into the *ListCommand* object. This object will then be ultimately returned to the *LogicManager*.
Next, the *LogicManager* will call the execute(model) method using the *ListCommand* object.
In this method, it wil use the *Model* object to call the methods :
updateFilteredOrderList and updateFilteredReturnOrderList.
Since in this case, the argument is empty, the predicate that is parsed to the two methods
will always result to true, which means to list
everything from the order book and return book.
When completed, the execute(model) will return a *CommandResult* object
to the *LogicManager*, indicating that the command execution is a success.

//tag::clear[]
=== Clear feature
In this section, the <<what-is-clear, functionality>> of the `clear` feature,
the expected <<clear-execution-path, execution path>>,
the <<clear-structure, structure>> of the *ClearCommand* class and the <<clear-interaction, interactions>>
between objects with the *ClearCommand* object will be discussed.

[[what-is-clear]]
==== What is the Clear feature
The `clear` feature was implemented as a *ClearCommand* in the logic package. +
The `clear` feature allows the user to remove the orders and return orders by input one command line. +

[[clear-execution-path]]
==== Execution paths of Clear Command
The execution path of the `clear` command is shown below: +

.Clear Class Activity Diagram
image::ClearActivityDiagram.svg[]

After user enter the `clear` command, the *ClearCommandParser* will run the following two checks: +

** Check if flag in the arguments do not belong to one of the three valid flags: `-f`, `-r` and `-o`
** Check if both `-r` and `-o` flags found in the arguments +

If either one of the conditions occurs, exception will be thrown and the error message will be display to the user.
Afterward,  the new *ClearCommand* object will be executed.

During the execution of the `clear` command:

** If `-f` flag is found in flags, the respective orders will be cleared and
display a success message to the user.
** If there are no `-f` flag found in flags, a pop up will appeared with the confirmation message.
   User would be required to press either one of the following two buttons:
*** `Yes` button - The respective orders will be cleared and display successful clear message to the user.
*** `No` button - Pop up closed and end of activity.

[[clear-structure]]
==== Structure of Clear Command
The following diagrams shows the overview of the `clear` command Class Diagram: +

.Clear Command Class Diagram
image::ClearCommandClassDiagram.svg[]

In the *ClearCommand* class, there are also some static messages for the different input command
the user has key in:

1. `MESSAGE_USAGE` +
clear: Clear either both order list and return order list or one of them. +
Parameters: -o/-r/-f +
Example: clear -o -f +

2. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_ORDER_LIST` +
Inform the user that order list has been cleared successfully.

3. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_RETURN_LIST` +
Inform the user that return order list has been cleared successfully.

4. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_BOTH_LIST` +
Inform the user that both order lists have been cleared successfully.

5. `MESSAGE_ENQUIRY_ORDER_LIST` +
Confirmation message to the user if the user want to clear order list.

6. `MESSAGE_ENQUIRY_RETURN_LIST` +
Confirmation message to the user if the user want to clear return order list.

7. `MESSAGE_ENQUIRY_BOTH_LIST` +
Confirmation message to the user if the user want to clear both order lists.

[[clear-interaction]]
==== Interactions between objects when Clear Command is executed
In this section, the interactions between objects when `clear` command is executed will be display in the Clear Command
Sequence Diagram below: +

.Clear Command Sequence Diagram
image::ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The above sequence diagram illustrate how the `clear` Command is being processed when the user inputs
`clear -f` to force clear all of the orders and return orders without any prompt.

After the user input. the arguments passed to the `clear` command will be parsed by the *ClearCommandParser* class +
If the given arguments are valid, a new *ClearCommand* object will be returned.

In *ClearCommandParser*, there will be two validation checks: +
1. Ensure the flag is one of the three flags: `-f`, `-o` and `-r` +
2. Ensure the arguments do not have both `-o` and `-r` flags.

After the two validation checks, the flag will be added into HashSet, *flags* which will then passed to
the new *ClearCommand* object created by *ClearCommandParser* and it is being returned to the *LogicManager*.
The *LogicManager* will start to run the execute the `clear` command, which will be
shown in details in below diagram:

.Execution of Clear Command Sequence Diagram
image::ExecuteClearCommand.svg[]

After *LogicManager* call the ClearCommand#execute(model), the `clear` command will update the model by pass a new
*OrderBook* object and a new *ReturnOrderBook* object to *Model*.  The *Model* will then update its own orderBook and
returnOrderBook. In addition, the `clear` command will pass back a new *CommandResult* object with the success message
in it to the *LogicManager* at the end of the execution.

//tag::delete[]
[[delete]]
=== Delete Feature
In this section, the <<what-is-delete, functionality>> of the `delete` feature, the
<<execution-paths-delete, expected execution path>>,
the <<structure-delete, structure>> of the *DeleteCommand* class and the <<interactions-delete, interactions>>
between objects with the *DeleteCommand* will be discussed.

[[what-is-delete]]
==== What is the Delete Feature
The `delete` feature allows the user to delete orders in either the order list or return order list. +

The `delete` feature was implemented as a *DeleteCommand* in the Logic package. +

The `delete` command has the following format: +

* `delete` `FLAG` `INDEX`

[NOTE]
====
1. A `FLAG` is a compulsory argument that indicates the list to delete from. +
It can be either `-o` or `-r`. +
A `-o` `FLAG` argument indicates deletion from the order list. +
A `-r` `FLAG` argument indicates deletion from the return order list. +

2. An `INDEX` is a compulsory argument that identifies the specific order to
delete in the list. +
The `INDEX` *must be a positive integer* i.e. 1, 2, 3, ...
====

[[execution-paths-delete]]
==== Execution paths of Delete command
In this section, you will learn more about the execution paths for the `delete` command.

.Delete Command Activity Diagram
image::DeleteActivityDiagram.svg[]

There are four possible execution paths for the `delete` command

1. User provides an invalid `delete` command input +
This results in a parse exception +

2. User provides a valid `delete` command input that has a flag indicating deletion
from the order list. +
The specified order will be deleted from the order list. +

3. User provides a valid `delete` command input that has a flag indicating deletion
from the return order list. +
The specified return order will be deleted from the return order list. +

4. User provides an invalid `delete` command input that has an invalid flag. +
A Command Exception wil be generated.

[[structure-delete]]
==== Structure of Delete command
In this section, you will learn more about the relationships between objects
related to the `delete` command.

.Delete Command Class Diagram
image::DeleteClassDiagram.svg[]

In the *DeleteCommand* class, there are also static strings present that represent the
various possible messages. +
For some of the message strings, there are placeholder %s strings used for including dynamic input +
These messages are the following:

1. `MESSAGE_DELETE_ORDER_SUCCESS` +
Deleted Order: %1$s +

2. `MESSAGE_DELETE_RETURN_ORDER_SUCCESS` +
Deleted Return Order: %1$s +

3. `MESSAGE_INVALID_FLAG` +
Invalid flag given! +

[[interactions-delete]]
==== Interactions between Delete command and its associated objects
In this section, you will learn more about the `delete` command and its inner workings.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `delete` command execution of
`delete` `-o` `1`. +
This indicates that the first order should be deleted from the order
list.

.Delete Command Sequence Diagram for `delete` `-o` `1`
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments passed to the `delete` command will be parsed by the *DeleteCommandParser* class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new *DeleteCommand* object will be returned. +
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a *ParseException*. +
Two checks will be done for the arguments:

1. Invalid `FLAG` argument

2. Invalid `INDEX` argument

When the *LogicManager* runs the `execute()` method of *DeleteCommand*,
*DeleteCommand* will first check the list to delete from. +

The deleteFromOrderList(model) method of *DeleteCommand* will then
be called and the filtered order list will be obtained from the getFilteredOrderList()
method of the model. +

The specified order at `INDEX` 1 will be deleted using the deleteOrder(order) method
in the model.

A new *CommandResult* will be created and returned to the *LogicManager*.


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `delete` command execution of
`delete` `-r` `2`. +
This indicates that the second order should be deleted from the return order
list.

.Delete Command Sequence Diagram for `delete` `-r` `2`
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

The arguments passed to the `delete` command will be parsed by the *DeleteCommandParser* class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new *DeleteCommand* object will be returned. +
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a *ParseException*. +
Two checks will be done for the arguments:

1. Invalid `FLAG` argument

2. Invalid `INDEX` argument

When the *LogicManager* runs the execute() method of *DeleteCommand*,
*DeleteCommand* will first check the list to delete from. +

The deleteFromReturnList(model) method of *DeleteCommand* will then
be called and the filtered return order list will be obtained from the getFilteredReturnOrderList()
method of the model. +

The specified return order at `INDEX` 2 will be deleted using the deleteReturnOrder(returnOrder) method
in the model.

A new *CommandResult* will be created and returned to the *LogicManager*.

[[delivered]]
=== Delivered Feature
In this section, the <<what-is-delivered, functionality>> of the `delivered` feature, the
<<execution-paths-delivered, expected execution path>>,
the <<structure-delivered, structure>> of the *DeliveredCommand* class and the <<sequence-delivered, interactions>>
between objects with the *DeliveredCommand* will be discussed.


[[what-is-delivered]]
==== What is the Delivered feature
The `delivered` function allows the user to mark orders or return orders
as delivered after delivering an order or a return order. +

The `delivered` feature was implemented as the *DeliveredCommand* in the logic package. +
The `delivered` function requires a valid <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> and a valid <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>>. +
i.e. `delivered` <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>

The <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> can either be '-o' or '-r', which indicates which list
(order list or return order list respectively) to mark the parcel from. The <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is
only valid when either '-o' and '-r' is used. All other inputs will be regarded as invalid. +

The <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is a positive integer that determines
which order or return order to be marked as delivered. The <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is only valid if
it is a positive integer and if it is not bigger than the size of the order list or return order list, depending
on the <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>that is provided. For instance, if the '-o' <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is provided,
the <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> should not be greater than the size of the order list. +

[[execution-paths-delivered]]
==== Execution Paths of Delivered Command
.Activity Diagram of the Delivered Command
image::DeliveredCommandActivityDiagram.png[]
The above activity diagram shows the logic behind the *DeliveredCommand* which is determined in
the *DeliveredCommandParser* class when the user inputs the command word `delivered` to activate the
`delivered` feature.

[[structure-delivered]]
==== Structure of Delivered Command
image::DeliveredClassDiagram.png[]
The above class diagram shows the structure of the *DeliveredCommand* and
its associated classes and interfaces. Some methods and fields are not included because they are
not extensively utilised in *DeliveredCommand*; such as public static fields and getter/setter methods.

[[sequence-delivered]]
==== Interactions between Delivered command and its associated objects
The sequence diagrams for the `delivered` command are shown below.

.Delivered Command Sequence Diagram
image::DeliveredSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Execution of Delivered Command
image::DeliveredSequenceDiagram2.png[]
The arguments typed into Delino by the user will first be done by the `execute`
method in `LogicManager`. After which, an `DelinoParser` object will be created to parse
the input which is determined by the command word via the parseCommand method. In this case, it is the
`delivered` command word that will be parsed. +

Then, a *DeliveredCommandParser* object will be created to parse the arguments after removing
the command word `delivered` from the user's input. Based on the command word `delivered`,
a *DeliveredCommand* object will be created. +

Subsequently, the parseCommand method in *LogicManager* will continue to create a *CommandResult*
based on the validity of the user's input; which is determined by the `execute` method in
*DeliveredCommand*. +

The `execute` method of *DeliveredCommand* will first check if a valid
<<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is present in the user's input. If the <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>
is not valid, a *CommandException* will be thrown to the user to tell him/her that their
input was invalid and tell them the format which their input should follow. +

If a valid <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> is present, this will trigger the
processDeliveryOfOrder method in *DeliveredCommand* which will check if
a valid <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is present in the user's input. +

If the <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> is not valid, processDeliveryOfOrder method will throw
a *CommandException* to the user; telling him/her that their input was invalid and the format
that their input should follow. i.e. `delivered` <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>
 <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> +

If both <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>> and <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> are valid, an *Order*
or *ReturnOrder* object will be created based on the <<command_prefix, `FLAG`>>.
The <<command_prefix, `INDEX`>> will determine which order or return order to take from
the order list or return order list respectively using the appropriate getter method.
The `Order` or `ReturnOrder` object will be checked to see if it was delivered using the `checkIfOrderWasDelivered(model)` method. +

If the *Order* or *ReturnOrder* was already delivered, this will call the updateOrderList(model) or
updatedReturnOrderList(model) method respectively in *DeliveredCommand* and a new
instance of *CommandResult* will be created to tell the user that the order or return order was delivered. +

If the *Order* or *ReturnOrder* was not delivered, this will call the deliverAndUpdateOrderList(model) or
deliverAndUpdateReturnOrderList(model) respectively in *DeliveredCommand*.
In these methods, the particular *Order* or *ReturnOrder* will be retrieved from the
model using the getFilteredOrderList() or getFilteredReturnOrderList() method.
Based on the retrieved *Order* or *ReturnOrder*, a new *Order* or *ReturnOrder* with the `delivered`
delivery status will be instantiated using the createDeliveredOrder or createDeliveredReturnOrder methods respectively. +

Then, the setOrder or setReturnOrder method will be called to replace the original *Order* or *ReturnOrder* object
respectively in model. The deliverOrder or deliverReturnOrder method will be called to to set the
delivery status of the object to delivered. Then, the updateFilteredOrderList() method or
updateFilteredReturnOrderList() method to update the list in the model. +

Based on the new updates, a new *CommandResult* object will be instantiated to print the message success to the user.

=== Edit Feature

In this section, the <<what-is-edit,functionality>> of the `edit` feature, the
expected <<edit-path-execution, execution path>>, the <<edit-structure, structure>> of the *EditCommand* class
and the <<edit-interactions, interactions>> between objects with the *EditCommand* object will be discussed.

[[what-is-edit]]
==== What is Edit Command

The `edit` feature was implemented as *EditCommand* in the Logic package. +

`edit` feature format : `edit` `INDEX` `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`/`NEW_VALUE` `[<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`/`NEW_VALUE]`

The `edit` feature allows the user to edit any field except delivery status of the order or the return order. However, user must provide a `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` and `INDEX`. +
`<<command_flags, FLAG>>` to indicate which parcel type to edit; `-o` and  `-r` `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` to represent Order or Return Order respectively. +
`INDEX` to indicate which parcel the user wants to edit. +
The list of the different parcel fields are listed in Appendix E: <<command_prefix, Glossary>>. +

[NOTE]
This feature allows user to edit more than one field within a command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
**Limitation **

* Editing the delivery/return time is that the updated delivery date or return date must not be in the past.
* There must be an order first for `edit` command to work.
====

[[edit-path-execution]]
==== Execution paths of Edit Command

.EditCommand Activity Diagram
image::EditCommandActivityDiagram.svg[]

The above figure illustrates the execution path of `edit` command when performed by the user. +

Input when received, will be parsed by the *DelinoParser*.
*DelinoParser* will check if command word matches any features command word. +
In this feature, the command word is `edit`. If no command word is detected, a exception class should be
generated for displaying of error message. *CommandException* is used in this feature to achieve that function. +

Once validated, user input is once again parse and check for validity. At this step, if user have provided input not matching the valid `edit` <<what-is-edit, format>>, an exception class is thrown. +
Furthermore, if `NEW_VALUE` is invalid an exception should be thrown as well. +
*ParseException* class is used in this scenario.

Some invalid `NEW_VALUE`: +
1) Editing delivery date or return date to the past. +
2) Change the transaction id of one parcel to match another parcel. +
3) Violation of any field(s) restriction. +

A correct input will prompts Delino to carry out the rest of the steps according. +
1) Checking of the `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` +
2) Edits the the parcel.
3) Display edit success message.

[[edit-structure]]
==== Structure of Edit Command

.Edit Command Class Diagram
image::EditCommandClassDiagram.png[]
The class diagram above depicts the structure of *EditCommand*. As per any *Command* class,
*EditCommand* needs to extend the abstract class *Command*. +
Information that are left out in this class diagram are the common messages used in *EditCommand*.

[[edit-interactions]]
==== Interactions between Edit Command and it's associated objects

.Edit Command Sequence Diagram
image::EditCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The above figure illustrates the important interactions of *EditCommand* when the user successfully edit the first displayed order name to `Alice`. +

The handling of breaking down the user input is done in the *EditCommandParser* class which is called upon by the
*DelinoParser* after an initial check for correctness of the command input. +

The *EditParcelDescriptor* class is a static class contained in the *EditCommand* class.
It act as a helper class to allow the setting of all the `NEW_VALUE` to the corresponding
`<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` in the *EditCommandParser* class.
The *EditParcelDescriptor* object is then passed back as a parameter to instantiate an *EditCommand*.
In the diagram above, the *EditParcelDescriptor* object is named as epd.
The *EditCommand* object is then passed back as e to the *LogicManager*
which will then call EditCommand#execute.
This execute method mainly calls the 3 helper method, not shown,
EditCommand#createEditedOrder/EditCommand#createEditedReturnOrder and EditCommand#generalSetParcel.
The main function of these methods are to help *EditCommand* in updating the *ObservableList* in the
*Model* class which is responsible for the updating of list displayed.

The *ObservableList* is a JavaFX class which listens and automatically changes the list once an update is performed.

[[return]]
=== Return Feature
In this section, the <<what-is-return,functionality>> of the `return` feature, the
expected <<execution-paths-return, execution path>>, the <<structure-return, structure>> of the *ReturnCommand* class
and the <<return-interactions, interactions>> between objects with the *ReturnCommand* object will be discussed.

[[what-is-return]]
==== What is the Return Feature
The `return` feature allows the user to either: +
1. Create a new return order from his/her input parcel attributes. +
2. Convert an existing delivered order to a return order.

The return feature was implemented as a *ReturnCommand* in the Logic package. +

The `return` command has two possible formats: +

1. `return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>>
If the user provides a valid <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> and <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>> in his input, the order with the given
<<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> will be converted into a return order with the same attributes but with the updated
<<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>>. The created return order will be added into the return order list.

2. `return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> <<command_prefix, `NAME`>> <<command_prefix, `ADDRESS`>> <<command_prefix, `PHONE_NUMBER`>>
<<command_prefix, `EMAIL`>> <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>> <<command_prefix, `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`>> <<command_prefix, `[COMMENTS]`>>
<<command_prefix, `[ITEM_TYPE]`>>
If the user provides these compulsory parcel attributes, a return order with the given parcel attributes will be created and added to the return order list.

[NOTE]
====
1. All return orders do not have the <<command_prefix, `CASH_ON_DELIVERY`>> parcel attribute.
2. The <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> is alphanumeric, which determines the <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> of the resulting return order.
3. The <<command_prefix, `NAME`>> consists of alphabets and determines the <<command_prefix, `NAME`>> of the resulting return order.
4. The <<command_prefix, `ADDRESS`>> is alphanumeric and determines the <<command_prefix, `ADDRESS`>>  of the resulting return order.
5. The <<command_prefix, `PHONE_NUMBER`>> consists of only numbers and determines the <<command_prefix, `PHONE_NUMBER`>> of the resulting return order.
6. The <<command_prefix, `EMAIL`>> is alphanumeric and determines the <<command_prefix, `EMAIL`>> of the resulting return order.
7. The <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>> should include the date in YYYY-MM-DD format and time in 24-hour format with a whitespace in between
the date and time.
8. The <<command_prefix, `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`>> is alphanumeric and it determines the <<command_prefix, `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`>> of the resulting return order.
9. The <<command_prefix, `[COMMENTS]`>> is an optional alphanumeric field and determines the <<command_prefix, `[COMMENTS]`>> of the resulting return order.
10. The <<command_prefix, `[ITEM_TYPE]`>> is an optional alphabetic field and determines the <<command_prefix, `[ITEM_TYPE]`>> of the resulting return order.
====

[[execution-paths-return]]
==== Execution paths of Return command
In this section, you will learn more about the execution paths for the `return` command.

.Return Command Activity Diagram
image::ReturnCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

There are three possible execution paths for the `return` command

1. User provides an invalid `return` command input +
This will result in a parse exception and an error message will be displayed to the user.
2. User provides a valid `return` command input with a valid <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> and
<<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>>, i.e. +
`return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>> +
If the order with the given <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> is delivered,
it will be converted to an existing order with the given <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> into a return order with the updated <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>>. +
This return order will then be added into the return order list.
3. User provides a valid `return` command input with all compulsory parcel attributes, i.e. +
`return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> <<command_prefix, `NAME`>> <<command_prefix, `ADDRESS`>> <<command_prefix, `PHONE_NUMBER`>>
<<command_prefix, `EMAIL`>> <<command_prefix, `RETURN_TIMESTAMP`>> <<command_prefix, `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION`>> <<command_prefix, `[COMMENTS]`>>
<<command_prefix, `[ITEM_TYPE]`>> +
If the given <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> does not exist as an order or return order,
this will create a new return order based on the given parcel attributes and the resulting return order
will be added to the return order list. +
If the given `return` <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> already exists as an order or return order, an error message
will be displayed to the user that an order or return order already exists in the order list or return order list respectively.
4. User provides a valid `return` command input with an invalid <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> +
This will result in a parse exception and an error message will be displayed to the user.
5. User provides a valid `return` command but one or more of the compulsory parcel attributes is/are invalid.
This will result in a parse exception and an error message will be displayed to the user.

[[structure-return]]
==== Structure of Return Command
image::ReturnClassDiagram.png[]
The above class diagram shows the structure of the *ReturnCommand*
and its associated classes and interfaces. Some methods and fields are not included because they are
not extensively utilised in *ReturnCommand*; such as public static fields and getter/setter methods.

[[return-interactions]]
==== Interactions between objects when Return Command is executed

The sequence diagrams for the `return` command are shown below.

==== Sequence Diagram for converting an order into a return order
The sequence diagrams for the *Return Command* are shown below.

.Return Command Sequence Diagram
image::ReturnSequenceDiagram1_a.png[]

.Execution of Return Command to convert a delivered Order into a Return Order
image::ReturnSequenceDiagram2_a.png[]
The arguments typed into Delino by the user will first be done by the `execute`
method in `LogicManager`. After which, an `DelinoParser` object will be created to parse
the input which is determined by the command word via the parseCommand method. In this case, it is the
`return` command word that will be parsed. +

Then, a `ReturnCommandParser` object will be created to parse the arguments after removing
the command word `return` from the user's input. Based on the command word `return`,
a `ReturnCommand` object will be created. +

Subsequently, the parseCommand method in `LogicManager` will continue to create a CommandResult
based on the validity of the user's input; which is determined by the `execute` method in
`ReturnCommand`. +

The `execute` method of `ReturnCommand` will first check if the return order in the constructor of
ReturnCommand is present. In this case, since we are converting an order into a return order,
the return order will not be present in the constructor of `ReturnCommand` and
the isReturnOrderNotPresent() method will return true. +

If the given <<command_prefix, `TRANSACTION_ID`>> exists in the order list, the
getOrderByTransactionId(model) method will attempt to create a new Order object from
the model's Order list based on the given transaction ID, i.e. orderToBeReturned. +

The checkIfOrderWasDelivered(model) method checks if the newly created Order is delivered. If the order was not
delivered, it will throw a command exception and display an error message to the user. +

If the order was delivered, Delino will proceed to check if the timestamp input was valid. If it was
invalid, an exception will be thrown and an error message will be displayed to the user.

If the order was delivered and the timestamp input was valid,
the deleteOrder(orderToBeReturned) method will be triggered to delete the order from the model's order list. Also, a new return order will be created based
on the ReturnOrder's constructor that takes in an Order, i.e. ReturnOrder(orderToBeReturned). This
creates a new Return Order object, toBeCreated. +

Subsequently, this newly created ReturnOrder object toBeCreated, will be checked against the
model's return order list using the hasParcel(toBeCreated) method. If it exists, a command exception will be thrown
and an error message will be displayed to the user. +

If the ReturnOrder does not exist in the model's return order list, the newly created ReturnOrder object,
toBeCreated, will be added to the model's return order list using the addReturnOrder(toBeCreated) method. +

Finally, a new CommandResult will be created to display the success message to the user for converting
a delivered order to a return order.

==== Sequence Diagram for creating a new return order
The sequence diagrams for the *Return Command* are shown below.

.Return Command Sequence Diagram

.Execution of Return Command to create a new Return Order
image::ReturnSequenceDiagram2_b.png[]
The arguments typed into Delino by the user will first be done by the `execute`
method in *LogicManager*. After which, an *DelinoParser* object will be created to parse
the input which is determined by the command word via the parseCommand method. In this case, it is the
`return` command word that will be parsed. +

Then, a *ReturnCommandParser* object will be created to parse the arguments after removing
the command word `return` from the user's input. Based on the command word `return`,
a *ReturnCommand* object will be created. +

Subsequently, the parseCommand method in *LogicManager* will continue to create a CommandResult
based on the validity of the user's input; which is determined by the `execute` method in
*ReturnCommand*. +

The `execute` method of *ReturnCommand* will first check if the return order in the constructor of
*ReturnCommand* is present. In this case, since we are creating a new return order from the given parcel attributes, a
return order will be created and it will be used in the constructor of *ReturnCommand* and
the isReturnOrderNotPresent() method will return false. +

Also, a new return order will be created based on the *ReturnOrder*'s constructor
that takes in an *Order*, i.e. ReturnOrder(orderToBeReturned). This
creates a new *ReturnOrder* object, toBeCreated. +

Subsequently, this newly created *ReturnOrder* object toBeCreated, will be checked against the
model's return order list using the hasParcel(toBeCreated) method.
If it exists, a command exception will be thrown
and an error message will be displayed to the user. +

If the *ReturnOrder* does not exist in the model's return order list, the newly created *ReturnOrder* object,
toBeCreated, will be added to the model's return order list using the addReturnOrder(toBeCreated) method. +

Finally, a new *CommandResult* will be created to display the success message to the user for creating a
new return order with the given parcel attributes.

=== Nearby Feature

In this section, the <<what-is-nearby,functionality>> of the `nearby` feature, the
expected <<nearby-path-execution, execution path>>, the <<nearby-structure, structure>> of the *NearbyCommand* class
and the <<nearby-interactions, interactions>> between objects with the *NearbyCommand* object will be discussed.

In this section, you will learn more about how the `nearby` feature is implemented.

[[what-is-nearby]]
==== What is the Nearby Feature
The `nearby` feature allows the user to view all orders that are located at a particular area
based on a given search criteria. +

The `nearby` feature was implemented as a *NearbyCommand* in the Logic package. +

The `nearby` command has two possible formats: +

1. `nearby` `FLAG` `POSTAL_SECTOR`
2. `nearby` `FLAG` `AREA`

[NOTE]
====
1. `FLAG` is an optional argument and indicates which order list to search on. +
It can be either `-o` or `-r`.
A `-o` `FLAG` argument indicates that the order list will be searched. +
A `-r` `FLAG` argument indicates that the return order list will be searched. +
By default, if no `FLAG` arguments are provided, both order list and return order list will be searched.

2. Searching of nearby orders is done by either `POSTAL_SECTOR` or `AREA` +

* A `POSTAL_SECTOR` refers to the first *two* digits of a six digit Singapore postal code. +
The list of postal sectors and their corresponding general locations can be found
https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/resources/misc/list_of_postal_districts.htm[on this website]. +

* An `AREA` refers to one of the five areas of Singapore:
** Central
** East
** North East
** West
** North
** You can obtain more detailed information about each area from
https://keylocation.sg/singapore/districts-map[this website]
====

[[nearby-path-execution]]
==== Execution paths of Nearby command
In this section, you will learn more about the execution paths for the `nearby` command.

.Nearby Command Activity Diagram
image::NearbyActivityDiagram.svg[]

There are four possible execution paths for the `nearby` command

1. User provides an invalid `nearby` command input +
This results in a parse exception +
2. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has no flags +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for all lists (order list and return order list) +
3. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has one flag. This flag indicates the order list (`-o`) +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for the order list.
4. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has one flag. This flag indicates the return order list (`-r`) +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for the return order list.

The matching orders are determined based on the given user argument. +
If a two digit integer is given, searching of nearby orders will be based on their postal sector. +
Else, searching of nearby orders will be based on their area. +
There are currently five areas that are searchable:

1. Central
2. East
3. North-East
4. West
5. North

[[nearby-structure]]
==== Structure of Nearby command
In this section, you will learn more about the relationships between objects
related to the `nearby` command.

.Nearby Command Class Diagram
image::NearbyClassDiagram.svg[]

In the *NearbyCommand* class, there are also static strings present that represent the
various possible messages. +
For some of the message strings, there are placeholder %s strings used for including dynamic input +
These messages are the following:

1. `MESSAGE_USAGE` +
nearby: View all orders located at the same postal sector based on the displayed list. +
Parameters: [FLAG] POSTAL_SECTOR or AREA +
An optional flag may be given to indicate the list to be searched for. +
The flag can be either -o for orders for -r for return orders +
A postal sector is the first two digits of a six digit Singapore postal code +
An area is one of the following: Central, East, North-East, West, North +
Example: nearby -o 14 +
Example: nearby -r central +
Example: nearby east +
2. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_POSTAL_SECTOR` +
Displayed all orders in postal sector. +
General Location: %1$s +
3. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_AREA` +
Displayed all orders in area (%s) +
4. `MESSAGE_FAILURE_POSTAL_SECTOR` +
Invalid postal sector given. +
5. `MESSAGE_FAILURE_AREA` +
Invalid area given. +

[[nearby-interactions]]
==== Interactions between Nearby command and its associated objects
In this section, you will learn more about the `nearby` command and its inner workings.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby` `-o` `14`. +
This indicates that the order list should be operated on and
all orders in the order list that have a `POSTAL_SECTOR` of `14`
should be displayed to the user.


.Nearby Command Sequence Diagram for `nearby` `-o` `14`
image::NearbyCommandSequenceDiagram1.svg[]

The arguments passed to the Nearby Command will be parsed by the *NearbyCommandParser* class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new *NearbyCommand* object will be returned. +
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a *ParseException*. +
Two types of invalid arguments are checked for: empty arguments
and arguments with only whitespace characters.

The execute() function of the *NearbyCommand* will first check if the given arguments
are in the format required for postal sector search (the argument can be converted into an integer).
If the first check is successful, the argument will be converted into an integer and
a second check is performed via the isValidPostalSector(Index postalSector) function
of the *NearbyCommandUtil* helper class.

[NOTE]
====
*NearbyCommandUtil* is a helper class that contains functions and variables used for
identifying postal sectors and their corresponding general locations. +
This class was created to reduce the responsibility of the *NearbyCommand* class. +

* A *HashMap* was used to store information about postal sectors and their respective general locations.
====

The model will then be updated by the updateFilteredOrderList(orderPredicate) function. +

A *CommandResult* is then generated and returned to the *LogicManager*.


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby` `-o` `central`. +
This indicates that the order list should be operated on and
all orders in the order list that have an `AREA` of `central`
should be displayed to the user.

.Nearby Command Sequence Diagram of `nearby` `-o` `central`
image::NearbyCommandSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

The *NearbyCommandParser* will check for invalid arguments given by the user. +
Invalid arguments can be either empty arguments or arguments with
only whitespace characters.
A *ParseException* will be generated if an invalid argument is present.

A new *NearbyCommand* will be created and returned to *LogicManager*.

*LogicManager* will then call the execute() function of the *NearbyCommand*. +
There will then be a check for whether the given argument is a valid area with the
function isValidArea(area) present in the *DistrictInfo* class.

[NOTE]
====
*DistrictInfo* is a helper class that contains functions and variables used for
identifying areas. +
This class was created to reduce the responsibility of the *NearbyCommand* class. +

====

The model will then be updated using the updateFilteredOrderList(orderPredicate) function.

A new *CommandResult* will be created and returned to the *LogicManager*.


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby`. +
This will result in a *ParseException* as invalid arguments are provided.

between objects with the `HelpCommand` object will be discussed.

[[what-is-help]]
==== What is the Help Feature
The `help` feature was implemented as the *HelpCommand* in the logic package. +
The `help` feature allows users to save the trouble of adding the delivery orders and the return orders one by one
when they have large amount of delivery orders or return orders to add into Delino.


[[execution-paths-help]]
==== Execution paths of the Help command
The execution path of the *HelpCommand* is shown below: +

.Help Command Activity Diagram
image::HelpCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

After the user enters the help command word, there will be a validation check to ensure that there are no
non-whitespace characters following after the `help` command word so that the help command can
be processed as a valid command.

If there are non-whitespace characters following `help` command word, a *ParseException* object will
be created and thrown to the user by displaying an error message.

If there are no non-whitespace characters following the `help` command word, a new *HelpCommand* object
will be created and a *CommandResult* object will be created subsequently to display the success message
to the user.

=== Import feature
In this section, the <<what-is-import, functionality>> of the `import` feature, the expected <<import-execution-path, execution path>>, the <<import-structure, structure>> of the
*ImportCommand* class and the <<import-interaction, interactions>> between objects with the *ImportCommand* object will be discussed.

[[what-is-import]]
==== What is the Import feature

The `import` feature allows users to save the trouble of adding the delivery orders and the return orders one by one
when they have large amount of delivery orders or return orders to add into Delino.

[[import-execution-path]]
==== Execution paths of Import Command
The execution path of the *ImportCommand* is shown below: +

.Import Command Activity Diagram
image::ImportActivityDiagram.svg[]

After the user enter the `import` command, there are three validation check for the file based on the input argument, `FILE_NAME`: +

* Check if the input argument has the .csv file extension at the back:
** If `Yes`, continue with the next validation check.
** If `No`, display error message to the user.

* Check if the filePath is valid: +

** If `Yes`, continue with the next validation check.
** If `No`, display error message to the user.

* Check if the file able to read: +

** If `Yes`, retrieve the data from the CSV file and process the data.
** If `No`, display the error message to the user.

Afterward, a new *ImportCommand* will be created and executed. For every data inside the list, either order or return order
will be added into the order book and return order book respectively based on the `orderType` value.
If the `orderType` is invalid, add the data into the result, which will be displayed to the user after processing.

[[import-structure]]
==== Structure of Import Command
The following diagram shows the overview structure of the *ImportCommand* Class Diagram: +

.Import Command Class Diagram
image::ImportClassDiagram.svg[]

In the *ImportCommand* Class, there are also a few static message to display to the user for the various scenarios occurred
during the importing of data from the CSV file: +

1.  `MESSAGE_USAGE` +
import: Import the data in .csv file into Delino +
Parameters: fileName.csv\n  +
Example: import orders.csv +

2. `INVALID_MESSAGE` +
Invalid order type encountered.

3. `DUPLICATE_ORDER_MESSAGE` +
Duplicate order encountered.

4. `DUPLICATE_RETURN_MESSAGE` +
Duplicate return order encountered.

5. `MESSAGE_INVALID_CSV_FILEPATH` +
The csv file is not found in the data folder.

6. `PROCESS_FAILED_MESSAGE` +
Failed to process the data. +
This could be due to invalid order type encountered or invalid data input for the attributes in
order and return order.

[[import-interaction]]
==== Interactions between objects when Import Command is executed
In this section, the interactions between the objects when *ImportCommand* is executed will be shown in the Import Command
Sequence Diagram below: +

.Import Command Sequence Diagram
image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments passed to the `import` command will be parsed by the *ImportCommandParser* class. +
Then, the *ImportCommandParser* will called the ParseUtil#parseCsvFile() to get the filePath based
on the input the user provides. Afterward, *CsvProcessor* will be called to retrieve the data from the csv file
and return the processed `fileData` back to ParseUtil. The `fileData` will be further pass to *ImportCommandParser*
and to the constructor of *ImportCommand*.

[NOTE]
====
*CsvProcessor* is  a helper class that helps to retrieve the data from the csv file and process the data before
giving to *ImportCommand*.

The ImportCommand#execute() will first check if the data given starts with
*order* or *return* and pass to the *InsertCommandParser* or *ReturnCommandParser* respectively. +

Afterwards, *InsertCommandParser* or *ReturnCommandParser* will return a new *InsertCommand* or *ReturnCommand* respectively
if it successfully parse the data. The *ImportCommand* will then call the InsertCommand#execute()
or ReturnCommand#execute() depend whether it is delivery order or return order.
This will cause a delivery order or return order being added into the Model.

The *ImportCommand* will call its own printResult() function and return a String message to the *CommandResult* object
which is then pass back to the *LogicManager*.

=== Search Feature

In this section, the <<what-is-search,functionality>> of the `search` feature, the expected
<<search-path-execution, execution path>>, the <<search-structure, structure>> of the *SearchCommand* class
and the <<search-interactions, interactions>> between objects with the *SearchCommand* object will be discussed.

[[what-is-search]]
==== What is the Search feature

The `search` feature was implemented as the *SearchCommand* in the logic package.

The `search` feature allow users to search for any orders according to the provided input. +

`search` feature format: `search` `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `<<command_prefix, [ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX]>>`/`[KEYWORD]`

[IMPORTANT]
A space is needed in between each word.

[NOTE]
Keyword search is case-insensitive. E.g: Given `Jeremy` it matches `JeReMy`, `jeremy` or any permutations of alphabet casing.

There are two mode of searching, *general search* or *specific search*. +
If the user does not provide any `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`, a *general search* mode will be
performed on orders, return orders, or both depending on the `<<command_flags, FLAG>>`. +

The `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `-o` when given, searches only for parcels in the order list. +
The `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `-r` when given, searches only for the parcels in the return order list.

* *General search* will search for all fields in an order/return orders/both that have any matching fields. +

If the user provide any `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`, a *specific search* will be performed. +

* *Specific search* will search orders/return orders/both based on the given `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`.

[[search-path-execution]]
==== Execution paths of Search Command

.Search Command Activity Diagram
image::SearchCommandActivityDiagram.svg[]

The above activity diagram illustrates the different execution paths of `search` command. +
Whenever a user keys in an input with the `search` keyword, the *SearchCommandParser* class will handle the parsing of input. +
User input will be validated in the *SearchCommandParser* class.

Input is deemed as invalid and *ParseException* is thrown under these scenarios: +
1) `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` given is not `-o` or `-r`. +
2) Multiple `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` detected. +
3) No `KEYWORD` is given after `search`.

View the list of allowed prefixes in this `search` command <<command_prefix, here>>.

[[search-structure]]
==== Structure of Search Command
.Search Command Class Diagram
image::SearchCommandClassDiagram.png[]

The above class diagram depicts the structure of the class *SearchCommand*. As per any *Command* class,
*SearchCommand* needs to extend the abstract class *Command*. +
Information that are left out in this class diagram are the common messages used in *SearchCommand*.

[[search-interactions]]
==== Interactions between objects when Search Command is executed

.Search Command Sequence Diagram
image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The sequence diagram above illustrates the interactions between objects when `search` command is performed by the user. +
Particularly, the interactions shown is a success `search` command executed by the user and only an abstract view is shown.


*LogicManager* first calls parseCommand with arguments representing the user input, `Alice`.
The *SearchCommandParser* will then check for any invalid arguments passed by the user. +

[TIP]
====
* If the given arguments are valid, *SearchCommandParser* will return  a new *SearchCommand* object. +
* If the given arguments are invalid or empty, a *ParseException* object will be thrown (not shown in the diagram).
====

The *SearchCommandParser* will then checks for the presence of any `<<command_flags, FLAG>>`.
The presence of one will result in different *SearchCommand* constructor being called. +
The *SearchCommandParser* will call the both the *OrderContainsKeywordsPredicate* constructor and
the *ReturnOrderContainsKeywordsPredicate* if no `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` is given. +
However, if a `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` is given, the corresponding predicate will be instantiated and passed
as an parameter for the *SearchCommand* constructor with the other left as null value.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* What is not shown is that optionally, either *OrderContainsKeywordsPredicate* or
*ReturnOrderContainsKeywordsPredicate* can be null if a `<<command_flags, FLAG>>` is given.
However, under no circumstances should both be null.
====

The parsing of user input utilises *ArgumentTokenzier* (not shown in sequence diagram) to process and split
each `KEYWORD` to it's corresponding `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`, if given any. +

If the preamble to any `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` is not empty, a *general search* will be performed in which `KEYWORD` will be searched through all fields of parcel. +
However, if `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` is given and the preamble is empty, the *specific search* will be performed. Only parcel fields that correspond to the given `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` will be searched and matched with the `KEYWORD`.

The order and return order list updates automatically as the JavaFX class *ObservableList* is used to listen to any changes.

[[show]]
=== Show feature
This section describes the <<show-functionality, functionality>> , the <<show-structure, structure>>,
<<show-interactions, interactions>> between objects and <<show-path, path>> the path execution of the `show` command.

[[show-functionality]]
==== What is the Show feature
The `show` feature allows the user to see the statistical information of all the orders for both Delivery Orders
and Return Orders.

There are a few ways in which the user can input to the command box to execute the `show` command:

* `show` `START_DATE` `[END_DATE]`

* `show` `all`

* `show` `today`

* `show` `DATE`

[[show-structure]]
==== Structure Show feature
The structure of the `show` feature is as shown below:

.Show Command Class Diagram
image:ShowCommandClassDiagram.svg[]

The above diagram shows all the methods and variables that the *ShowCommand* class is using when the command is
executed. All the static methods and variables are not mentioned in this diagram. Furthermore, there are
some methods and variables omitted from this diagram as it is irrelevant to the *ShowCommand* class.

[[show-path]]
==== Path execution of the Show Command
.Show Command Activity Diagram
image::ShowCommandActivityDiagram.svg[]

The above activity diagram shows the logic and the path execution when the `show` command is executed.

The main logic of the *ShowCommand* is to check if the number of arguments in the input besides `show` is one or two.
If it is neither, the code will throw an exception. If there is only one argument, the code will check if the word
provided is either `all` or `today` or simply just a `DATE` the value of `DATE` will be validated to check
if it is a valid date.
It throws an error if it is invalid. When its correct, the code will execute the input accordingly.
If the number is two arguments, it will check if the dates provided are valid or invalid date.
It throws an error for the latter. The code will then ensure that the `START_DATE` is before the `END_DATE`.
Once the input passes all the validations in the *ShowCommand* code,
the command will then be executed and it prints a success message to the user.

[[show-interactions]]
==== Interaction between objects during execution of Show Command
The sequence diagram for the `show` command is shown below: +

.Show Command Sequence Diagram
image::ShowCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The user first calls the command "show all".
[NOTE]
====
It can accept either one or two arguments.
====

The *LogicManager* will call the parseCommand method of *DelinoParser*, which then passes the second argument
into the *ShowCommand* object. Within the object, it will call the parseData method to make sense of the dates given.
After that, it returns the object to the `LogicManager`.
Next, the *LogicManager* will call the execute(model) method using the *ShowCommand* object.
When completed, the execute(model) will return a *CommandResult* object to the *LogicManager*, indicating that the command execution is a success.
In this case where the input is "show all", it will have a message that indicates that the command is showing all information.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The *LogsCenter* class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The *Logger* for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Effort

*Overview* +
Our team wanted to make an application that could reduce the hassle of managing couriers' orders. We decided to build
Delino which aims to provide a centralised platform for couriers to easily manage their deliveries. Delino is
significantly different from Address Book 3 (AB3). In addition to the existing basic features of AB3, we needed to add
additional features to satisfy the needs of our target audience, couriers. Features that are unique to Delino are
Nearby, Show, Import, Return and the enhanced Search.

*Challenges faced* +

. *Brainstorming of ideas* - Ideation was the first hurdle we faced as a team. Coming up with ideas was easy, however,
the conflict arose when we were deciding on which idea to implement as every member wanted to solve a different problem.
We listed the pros and cons of each proposed idea, and had a few group meetings to evaluate the proposed ideas. We
finally chose an idea that was deemed to be most feasible.

. *Debugging* - Had to spend a huge amount of time tracing through the code of more than 7kLoC in order to determine
coding bugs/errors. Sometimes, the problem could have been solved by a simple removal or addition of a line of code,
in order to resolve the long list of error messages that were displayed to us.


. *Separate the return order from order* - It is important to be able to show two lists, one with orders and the other
with return orders. However, this caused list updating to be a major problem for most of the commands. This required
significant modifications to our code.


. *Documentation* - It was difficult to efficiently ensure that everything was standardised in the user guide and
developer guide as we encountered a lot of different terms that required group discussion before we could finalise
on a proper way of dealing with it.

In order to deal with this documentation problem, it often resulted in us having to meet up for long hours (up to 10
hours/day) on consecutive days in order for us to finalise a document together. As a result, it was one of the most
time-consuming parts of this project as we usually had to use one person’s screen and go through an entire document
together so that we could standardise it consistently.

*Achievements* +

. *Implementing commands* - Ensuring that our commands were implemented in an OOP manner was essential for further
extension or fixing of bugs. Throughout the project, we made various code restructuring to allow for better code
maintainability.

. *Maintaining test coverage* - As a group, we set a soft-limit for our test coverage to be 80% as we wanted to ensure
that the code that we wrote as a team is functional and extensively covered by all the different test-cases. As much as
possible, we applied the different testing methods taught in lessons such as Regression testing, Integration testing
and Unit testing.

*Conclusion* +
In conclusion, Our team had a great time working with one another and we are proud to have come up with a product like
Delino by working tirelessly to build it together. Overall, we believe that Delino is a good testament to our hard work
and time spent on perfecting it.
