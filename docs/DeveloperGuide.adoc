.  Should work on any <<mainstream-os,mainstream OS>> as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 food items without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
.  Should be usable by users who have never used an e-directory
.  The application should have images for the food items, if the food items are shown to the user
.  The system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system
