== Introduction

TA-Tracker
is a productivity tool made for *NUS School of Computing (SoC) Teaching Assistants (TAs)*
who want to be able to track and manage their *students* and *claimable
hours* in one place.

Teaching Assistants at SoC have to keep a track of:

* claimable hours so that they can fill up the TSS Claims form at the end of each semester.
* teaching-related sessions with claimable hours
* students and their contact information
* students' participation marks
* notes for certain students (such as recommendations)

Rather than managing this through several excel
spreadsheets and notes, TA-Tracker
allows TAs to track everything in a single, convenient-to-use
platform.

In particular, TA-Tracker
is a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* application packaged
with a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. This means that users are expected to interact
with the TA-Tracker
mainly through the command line, and each command executed will
evoke a visual response in the TA-Tracker
.

Any help on the development of the TA-Tracker
would be greatly appreciated, and there
are a couple of ways that you can do so:

* contribute to TA-Tracker
's code base by expanding its features
* help us improve test coverage
* propose and implement improvements on current features

This guide aims to kick-start your journey as a contributor to the TA-Tracker
by getting
you up to speed with how TA-Tracker
's codebase and inner workings function. It also
hopes to serve as a useful reference to current contributors in times of confusion or
when faced with difficulties.

== Setting up

You can refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

TA-Tracker
has been designed with `Object-Oriented Programming`
principles in mind. We also attempted to use `Defensive Programming` wherever
possible. This section serves to give a description of the
major components in the architecture of TA-Tracker
. Subsequent sections
provide more information on the inner workings of individual components.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the TA-Tracker
.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by the other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the TA-Tracker
's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the TA-Tracker
.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Handles execution of TA-Tracker
commands.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Organises the data of the TA-Tracker
into different sections.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the _Class Diagram_ given below) defines its API in the `Logic` interface
and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager` class.

.Simplified Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other
for the scenario where the user enters the command `session delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `session delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

The _Class Diagram_ below shows how the `UI` components interact with each other.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`StudentTab`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. The UI also contains 2 more windows, namely:

. the `HelpWindow` and
. the `StatisticsWindow`

The `UI` component uses *JavaFx* UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in
matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the
layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is
specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

==== Tabs

The _Class Diagram_ below shows how the components in the `Student Tab` interact with each other.

.Structure of the Student Tab Component
image::StudentTabClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
All the `ListPanels` and `Cards` inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
====

The UI contains 3 `tabs`:

. The `Student Tab`
. The `Session Tab`
. The `Claims Tab`

Each of these tabs consist of one or more List Panels (e.g. `StudentListPanel`) and its
respective Card (e.g. `StudentCard`). In each List Panel, the the `Graphics` component of
each of the List Cells is defined by the respective Card.

The other 2 `Tabs` follow the same structure as the _Class Diagram_ above.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

The `Logic` component of `TA-Tracker
`:

* processes user inputs into different `Command` objects,
* executes these `Command` objects to interact with the `Model` component, and
* saves data in the `Storage` component.

==== Logic Structure
The following _Class Diagram_ shows a simplified view of the structure of the `Logic` component .

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram1.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

In the figure above, you can see that:

. `Logic` behaves as a Fa√ßade class between the different `TA-Tracker
` components.
. `LogicManager` is the main driver class behind the logic in `TA-Tracker
`
. `LogicManager` interacts with classes in the `Model` and `Storage` component.
. `TA-Tracker
` logic is organised into *commands* and *parsers*.
. `TaTrackerParser` is the *main parser*.
. A `Command` can interact with classes in the `Model` component.

==== Logic Hierarchy

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how the `commands` and `parsers` are organised.

.Structure of commands and the hierarchy of parsers
image::LogicClassDiagram2.png[]

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* `X` is the category name for a group of commands +
(e.g. `Student`, `Session`, `Module`).
* `XY` is the category name for actions specific to a group of commands +
(e.g. `AddStudent`, `EditSession`, `DeleteModule`).
====

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* `Prefixes` contains some `Prefix` constants that are shared among classes in the *Logic component*.
* The *red arrow* shows that each command knows about the `Prefix` constants stored in `Prefixes`.

====

In addition to Figure 6., in the figure above, you can see that:

. There is a *hierarchy* of parsers, starting from `TaTrackerParser`.
. Each group of parsers have been split into *smaller packages* (named as `X` in the diagram)
within the package of parsers.
. Each `Command` has a `Parser` that creates it from a user input.
. These `Command` classes are placed in *smaller packages* (with the same name `X`) within the package of commands.
. A `Command` produces a `CommandResult` when executed by `LogicManager`.
* This will modify the `Model` internally (e.g. adding a student).
. The resulting `CommandResult` encapsulates the feedback that needs to be passed to the `Ui`. +
This feedback includes:
* showing messages in the `UI`, and
* instructing the `Ui` to perform certain actions (e.g. displaying the `HelpWindow`).

====
[horizontal]
In most cases, there are *two levels* of parsing before a command is created +
(i.e. `XCommandParser` passes the parsing to `XYCommandParser`).

However there are some cases where only *one level* of parsing is needed +
(e.g. for the `help`, `report`, and `exit` commands).

.Skipping the second layer of parsers
image::LogicClassDiagram3.png[,500]

These command parsers will immediately create the respective `Command`,
*skipping the second layer* of parsers (represented by the *red arrow* in the figure above).
====

==== Overview of Commands

The following _Class Diagram_ illustrates how all `commands` have been packaged under their respective categories.

.Structure of commands in different categories
image::CommandsPackageDiagram1.png[]

These packages depend on the `Command` class since they contain commands that inherit from the `Command` class (not shown above).

In addition, the following `Class Diagram` shows the information that a `command` should have.

.Internal structure of all commands
image::CommandsPackageDiagram2.png[,500]

. In each package, all commands should have their own `CommandDetails`.
. `CommandDetails` store all the information that each command should have, +
(e.g. their `commandWord` and `usage` message).
. For their `commandWord` and `sub word`, commands may use constants in `CommandWords` to avoid repetition +
(e.g. "add", "delete", "edit").
. The `CommandDictionary`, stores a list of `CommandDetails` for all the commands.
. The `CommandDictionary` is used for:
* *syntax highlighting*, and
* listing information in the *help window*

==== Overview of Parsers

In a similar way, all *parsers* have been packaged under the same respective categories.

.Structure of parsers in different categories
image::ParserPackageDiagram1.png[]

These packages depend on the `Parser` interface since they contain command parsers that inherit from the `Parser` interface
(not shown above).

In addition, the following `Class Diagram` shows the information that a `command parser` should have.

.Internal structure of all command parsers
image::ParserPackageDiagram2.png[,300]

. All command parsers use some `Prefix` constants defined in `Prefixes`.
. `PrefixDetails` adds more information to a `Prefix` +
(e.g. their `constraint` message and a list of `examples`).
. A `PrefixDetail` has a `Predicate` to validate the user input arguments.
. The `PrefixDictionary` stores two lists of `Prefix` objects:
** `parameters` - a list of command parameters, and
** `optionals` - a list of optional parameters for the same command.
. The `PrefixDictionary` stores a list of `PrefixDetails` for all the `Prefix` objects in `parameters` and `optionals`.
. The `PrefixDictionary` is used for:
* *syntax highlighting*, and
* listing information in the *help window*

==== Example Logic Sequence
Given below is the _Sequence Diagram_ for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("group add m/CS2103 g/G03 t/lab")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `group add m/CS2103 g/G03 t/lab` Command
image::AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* The lifeline for `GroupCommandParser` and `AddGroupCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* Since the purpose of this diagram is to show the interactions within the `Logic` component,
irrelevant interactions with the `Model` component have been omitted.
====

==== Design Considerations

===== Rationale behind `PrefixDetails` not inheriting from the `Prefix` class
The following _Class Diagrams_ compare the structure of `commands` and their respective `parsers.`

[.clearfix]
--
[.left]
.Structure of a `command parser`
image::ParserPackageDiagram2.png[,300]
[.left]
.Structure of a `command`
image::CommandsPackageDiagram2.png[,500]
--

The difference between the *commands* and *parsers* is that the *commands* store their own `CommandDetails`,
while the *parsers* do not store any `PrefixDetails`. Instead, they use a number of `Prefix` objects to
parse user inputs. This is because they do not need the extra information stored in `PrefixDetails`.

`PrefixDetails` adds more information to a `Prefix` instead of extending it.
Therefore, it can be detached from the command parsers without changing the `Prefix` constants in `Prefixes`.

===== Moving `Prefixes` to the *Commands* package

In future versions, `Prefixes` could be stored in the *Commands* package,
since each command will need to know all the `Prefix` that they are using.

The following `Class Diagrams` shows how the command parsers can obtain all the required `Prefix` from the respective `command.`

.Improving the Logic component
image::LogicClassDiagram4.png[,500]

In the diagram above:

* The *red arrow* will be removed to show that the command parsers no longer need information in `Prefixes`.
* `Prefixes` will be moved into the *commands* package.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how the different `Model` components interact with each other.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores the TA-Tracker
data
* Exposes 5 unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` objects:
. `filteredStudentList`, an that contains all the `Students` in the TA-Tracker

. `filteredSessionList`, an that contains all the `Sessions` in the TA-Tracker
that have *not* been marked as done
. `filteredDoneSessionList`, an that contains all the `Sessions` in the TA-Tracker
that *have been marked as done*
. `filteredModuleList`, an that contains all the `Modules` in the TA-Tracker

. `filteredGroupList`, an that contains all the `Groups` in the TA-Tracker

* These lists can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change
* Does not depend on any of the other three components

The following _Class Diagram_ shows the relationship between the different classes
in the `Model` component.

.Model Components - Class Diagram
image::ModelComponentsClassDiagram.png[]

==== Example of Model Usage

The following _Object Diagram_ shows an example of the relationship between the different `Model` objects.
This example is based on the state of TA-Tracker
when it is first run (without any user data).

.Model Components - Object Diagram
image::ModelObjectDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
The following `Class Diagram` is a simplified view of the `Storage` component.

.Simplified structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram1.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the TA-Tracker
data in json format and read it back.

==== Saved Data
The following `Class Diagram` is a breakdown of the data managed by the `Storage` component.

.Structure of the data stored by TA-Tracker

image::StorageClassDiagram2.png[]

`TA-Tracker
` saves the following data:

* a list of `Module` objects representing the modules that the user is assisting. +
+
Within each module, there is:

** a list of `Session`, representing the `done sessions` that the user has completed for that module.
** a list of `Group`, representing the groups that the user is
in charge of, such as a tutorial or lab. +
+
Within each group, there is:

*** a list of `Student`, representing the students enrolled in
the respective groups.

* a separate list of `Session` objects representing the sessions that the user has scheduled in the future.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tatracker.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

[[Implementation-Goto]]
=== Goto Command

==== Description

The `goto` command has been implemented to allow users to programmatically switch through the `tabs` using
the command line, rather than clicking on the tab headers.

The command can be utilised by inputing `goto TAB_NAME`.
`TAB_NAME` is a compulsory parameter for the user.

==== Implementation
This section describes the implementation of the `goto` command.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions between the `Logic` and `UI` components of
the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the command `goto claims`.

.Sequence Diagram for Goto Claims Command
image::GotoSequenceDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example scenario where the user enters a command to switch to the `Claims Tab`.

. The user command is passed through the `LogicManager` to `TaTrackerParser`.
`TaTrackerParser` checks the input arguments and identify the String keywords.

. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a `GotoCommand` and passes the command
to the `GotoCommandParser`.

. The `GotoCommandParser` creates a `GotoCommand` object
with the relevant keywords.

. `LogicManager` calls `GotoCommand` 's execute method.

. The `GotoCommand` object checks whether any of the keywords given by the user
matches the existing tab headers. If it does, the `GotoCommand` returns a `CommandResult`
with a success message.

. `MainWindow` selects the `ClaimsTab` in the `TabPane` to switch to the `Claims Tab`

[[StudentView]]
=== Student View
*Student View* is used to display all modules, groups and students in the TA-Tracker
.

Students are a part of *groups* and groups are a part of *modules*.

==== Implementation of the Model Framework
The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the
functioning of the *Student View*.

.Student View - Class Diagram
image::ModuleModelClassDiagram.png[]

In the diagram above, you can see that:

* The `TaTracker` class contains a `UniqueModuleList` which helps it keep track
of the different *modules* the user is teaching.

* Each `Module` contains a `UniqueGroupList`.

* The `UniqueGroupList` contains a list of all the *groups of a module* that the user
is teaching.

* Each `Group` contains a `UniqueStudentsList` that contains the *students in that group*.

====
*Alternative Implementation*

* An alternative implementation would be to have a single `UniqueModuleList` to store
all modules, a `List` to store all groups and a `List` to store all students.

* We would then have to filter by module code and/or group code to show the appropriate
groups and students.

* This would require students to keep track of which group and which module they're
a part of. Similarly, groups would have to keep a track of the students it contains.
This would create a cyclic dependency (which could be solved using an association class).

* The `List` of groups could contain multiple groups with the same group code as group code
is only unique within a module. Group codes can be shared across modules.

* While this implementation would make it easier to generate a report at the end of
the semester (explained towards the end of the guide), it would require more commands
and the creation of association classes which would unnecessarily complicate the model.
That is why we decided to stick to our current implementation.

====

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the functioning of a `Student` Object.

.Structure of the Student Component
image::StudentClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/model/student/Student.java[`Student.java`]

The other models (`Module`, `Group` and `Session`) have been implemented in a similar manner. The main difference is that the other models do not
have any `Tags`.

[NOTE]
As a more `OOP` model, we can store a `Tag` list in `TaTracker`, which `Student` can
reference. This would allow `TaTracker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique
`Tag`, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of what
such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of the Module Add, Delete and Edit Commands

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions
between the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the
command `module add m/CS2103 n/Software Engineering`.

.Module Add - Sequence Diagram
image::AddModuleSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* This diagram assumes that a module with the module code `CS2103`
exists in the TA-Tracker
.
* The lifeline for `ModuleCommandParser` and `AddModuleCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that this command is a *module* command and passes the
command to the `ModuleCommandParser`.

3. The `ModuleCommandParser` sees that this command is an *add* command and passes the
arguments to the `AddModuleCommandParser`.

4. The `AddModuleCommandParser` creates a `Module` with the given module code and
name.

5. The `AddModuleCommandParser` then creates an `AddModuleCommand` object with a newly
created module. The parser then returns the `AddModuleCommand` object.

6. `LogicManager` calls `AddModuleCommand` 's execute method.

7. The `AddModuleCommand` object
checks whether a module with the given module code already exists in *TA-Tracker
*

.. If it does, a command exception is thrown saying that a module with the given module
code already exists in the *TA-Tracker
*.

.. If no such module exists, the module is added to the *TA-Tracker
*.

8. The `AddModuleCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The command used to delete a module has been implemented in a similar way. The main
difference is that the `DeleteModuleCommand` checks whether an object with the given
module code exists in the TA-Tracker
. If no such module exists, a command exception
is thrown saying that a module with the given module code doesn't exist. If it does
exist, *first all the sessions linked to that module are removed* , then the module
is removed from the TA-Tracker
.

The `module edit` command has been implemented in a similar manner.

==== Implementation of the Group Add, Delete and Edit Commands

A *group* is added to the TA-Tracker
in a similar manner to to how a *module* is added to
the TA-Tracker
.

The following steps are taken once the _execute_ command of an `AddGroupCommand` object
is called:

. The `AddGroupCommand` object checks whether the *module* is present in the model of the TA-Tracker
.
.. If it exists, the module is retrieved.
.. If it doesn't exist, an exception is thrown explaining that the module doesn't
exist.
. The `AddGroupCommand` object checks whether a *group* with the same group code as
the new group exists in the module retrieved beforehand.
.. If it doesn't exist, the group is added to the module and a `CommandResult` object
with the success message is returned.
.. If it does exist, an exception is thrown explaining that you can't have two groups
with the same group code in a module.

The interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components when adding a group are similar
to the interactions when deleting a group as shown below.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions between the `logic` and `model`
components when the user inputs the command `group delete m/CS2103 g/G03`.

.Group Delete - Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* This diagram is under the case where a group with the group code G03 does exist
in the module with module code CS2103 inside the TA-Tracker
.

* The lifeline for `GroupCommandParser` and `DeleteGroupCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* The main difference between the `Module` and `Group` commands is that the `Group`
commands require extra checks to check whether a group with the given group code
exists inside the module with the given module code.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is of type *group* and passes the
command to the `GroupCommandParser`.

3. The `GroupCommandParser` sees that the command is of type *delete* and passes the
arguments to the `DeleteGroupCommandParser`.

4. The `DeleteGroupCommandParser` then creates a `DeleteGroupCommand` object and passes
it the module code, group code and group type. The parser then returns the `DeleteGroupCommand` object.

5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteGroupCommand` 's execute method. The `DeleteGroupCommand` object
checks whether a *module* with the given module code already exists in TA-Tracker
.
If it doesn't, a command exception is thrown saying that a module with the given module
code doesn't exist in the TA-Tracker
.

6. If the module exists, the `DeleteGroupCommand` then checks whether a group with the
given group code exists within that module.
.. If the group doesn't exist, a command exception is thrown saying that no such group exists.
.. If the group does exist, it is removed from the module.

7. The `DeleteGroupCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The `group edit` command has been implemented in a similar manner.

==== Implementation of the Student Add, Delete and Edit Commands

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions that take place
between the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the
command `student delete id/A0181234G`.

.Student Delete - Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====

* This diagram assumes that there is a student with the matric number `A0181234G`
already exists in the TA-Tracker

* The lifeline for `StudentCommandParser` and `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is of type *student* and passes the
command to the `StudentCommandParser`.

3. The `StudentCommandParser` sees that the command is of type *delete* and passes the
arguments to the `DeleteStudentCommandParser`.

4. The `DeleteStudentCommandParser` creates a *Student* with the given matric number,
`A0181234G`.

5. The `DeleteStudentCommandParser` then creates a `DeleteStudentCommand` object and passes
it the created student. The parser then returns the `DeleteStudentCommand`

6. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteStudentCommand's` execute method.

7. The `DeleteStudentCommand` object
checks whether a student with the given matric number already exists in TA-Tracker

.. If it student doesn't exist, a command exception is thrown saying that a student with the given matric number
doesn't exist in the TA-Tracker
.. If the student exists, the `DeleteStudentCommand` object retrieves the student from the
model and removes the student.

The `student edit` command has been implemented in a similar manner.

The `student add` command has been implemented in a similar way as well. The main
difference is that the `AddStudentCommand` checks whether an object with the given
matric number exists in the TA-Tracker
. If such student exists, a command exception
is thrown saying that a student with the given matric number already exists.

==== Implementation of the Sort Group, Module and All Command

The sort command allows the user to sort the students in the *Student View*. Here are the ways you can use the sort command:

. alphabetically
. rating (in ascending or descending order)
. matriculation number

The sort command can be used in three ways:

1. `sort group g/GROUP_CODE m/MODULE_CODE t/TYPE` : This sorts all the students of the given
group in the given module by type `TYPE`.

2. `sort module g/MODULE_CODE t/TYPE` : This sorts all the students of all the groups in the
given module by type `TYPE`.

3. `sort all t/TYPE` : This sorts all students of all groups of all the modules in the
TA-Tracker
by the type `TYPE`

[NOTE]
====
* `TYPE` here could mean any of the following:
** `alpha`, `alphabetical` or `alphabetically` to sort alphabetically.
** `rating asc` to sort by rating in ascending order.
** `rating desc` to sort by rating in descending order.
** `matric` to sort by matriculation number.
====

Since these `Sort` commands function differently but use the same parser, the structure shown in the following
_Class Diagram_ is used.

.Sort Commands - Class Diagram
image::SortCommandsClassDiagram.png[]

Since the different commands use the same parser, the `SortCommandParser` needs to:

. check which prefixes have been passed and
. return the appropriate command accordingly.

The following _Activity Diagram_ shows the steps the `SortCommandParser` takes once
its _parse_ method is called (assuming that no exception is thrown).

.SortCommandParser - Activity Diagram
image::SortParserActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* The final else clause would throw an error explaining that the command format is
invalid. But due to a limitation in *PlantUML's* beta version of showing activity diagrams,
we were unable to indicate exceptions thrown in the proper way and decided to mention
it here instead.

* Command word here refers to `all`, `module` or `group`.

* If the user enters the `sort` command with a command word but doesn't include the
appropriate parameters with the correct prefixes, a command exception is thrown.
====

The following _Sequence Diagram_ illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and
`Model` components when the user enters the command `sort all t/matric`.

.Sort - Sequence Diagram
image::SortAllSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* The `SortCommandParser`, which creates `Sort` commands, is different from the other
command parsers. While the other commands have another level of parsing (such as the
`ModuleCommandParser` for `Module` commands), the `SortCommandParser`
creates all the different Sort commands within itself.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is of type `sort` and passes the
command to the `SortCommandParser`.

3. The `SortCommandParser` performs the steps shown in the previous activity diagram
and determines that since the sort command word is `all` , it must create and return a
`SortCommand`.

4. `LogicManager` calls `SortCommand` 's execute method.

5. `SortCommand` checks the type of sorting that is indicated. Since the sort type
is `matric` , it calls `Model` 's `sortModulesByMatricNumber()` command.

6. The `SortCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

[[SessionView]]
=== Session View

*Session View* is the term used to refer to the view that contains a list of all sessions
that haven't been completed yet.

==== Model Framework

The following _Class diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the functioning
of the *Session View*.

._Class Diagram_ of Session View
image::SessionModelClassDiagram.png[]

The TA-Tracker model class contains a `UniqueSessionList` which helps keep track of
all the *sessions* in TA-Tracker
that have *not* been marked as done.

==== Implementation of the Session Done Command

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the sequence of commands that take place between
the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the command
`session done 1`.

._Sequence Diagram_ for Done Session
image::DoneSessionSequenceDiagram.png[]

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a `Session` command and passes the command
to the `SessionCommandParser`.

3. The `SessionCommandParser` sees that the command is a `DoneSessionCommand` and passes the
arguments to the `DoneSessionCommandParser`.

4. The `DoneSessionCommandParser` creates a `DoneSessionCommand` with the given index.

5. `LogicManager` calls `DoneSessionCommand#execute()` method.

6. The `DoneSessionCommand`
checks whether the current session called by the user has a recurring period.

    a. If it does, a new session with the updated date will be added to `Model#UniqueSessionList()`.
    b. If it does not have a recurring period, it will move on to *Step 6*.

7. The current session will be removed from `Model#UniqueSessionList`.

8. The updated session list will be displayed to the user.

The following _Activity Diagram_ describes how TaTracker is updated when a `SessionDone` command is entered.

.Session Done- Activity Diagram
image::TssActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The above diagram assumes that a valid index has been input into the TA-Tracker
during the done session command.
====

==== Implementation of Session Add, Edit and Delete

The `session edit` and `session delete` commands have been implemented in a similar manner
to `DoneSessionCommand`.


The `session add` command has been implemented in a similar way. The main difference is that the
`SessionAddCommand` checks whether an object with the given module code exists in the TA-Tracker.

* If no such module code exists, the session is created successfully.

* If it doesn‚Äôt exist, an exception is thrown saying that the given module code doesn‚Äôt exist.

//tag::claimsview[]

=== Claims View
*Claims View* refers to the view that contains a list of all the sessions that have
been done.

==== Model Framework
The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the
functioning of the *Claims View*.

.Claims View - Class Diagram
image::TssModelClassDiagram.png[]

The TaTracker model class contains a UniqueDoneSessionList which keeps track of
all the *sessions that have been marked as done*. Each of the sessions must belong to a Module in the UniqueModuleList.

==== Set Rate Command

Given below is an example scenario where the user enters the command `setrate 50`.

. The user command is passed through the `LogicManager` to `TaTrackerParser`.

. `TaTrackerParser` checks the input arguments and identify the String keywords.

. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a type of SetRate and passes the command
to the `SetRateCommandParser`.

. The `SetRateCommandParser` object checks that the given `RATE` input
by the user is a valid integer. If it is, the `SetRateCommandParser` creates a
`SetRateCommand` object with the relevant integer.

. `LogicManager` calls `SetRateCommand` 's execute method.

. `MainWindow` updates the `TotalEarnings` label in the `ClaimsTab` and the `StatisticsWindow`


// tag::syntaxhighlighting[]
=== Syntax Highlighting
When a user types a command into the `CommandBox`, their inputs will be highlighted in different colours
as a form of input validation.

In addition, the `ResultDisplay` will display different messages based on the result of the syntax highlighting.

The following shows how the `CommandBox` and `ResultDisplay` appear in the `MainWindow` of `TA-Tracker
`

.The `CommandBox` and the `ResultDisplay` in `TA-Tracker
`
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-CommandBox.png[]

In the figure above:

* There is a user input highlighted in `green` in the `CommandBox`
* There is a message in `white` showing in the `ResultDisplay`
* The command being entered is `session edit`
* There are three arguments: `date`, `start time`, and `end time`.

==== Overview
The following _Class Diagram_ shows how the `Logic` and `UI` components interact with each other to produce the highlighting.

.Syntax Highlighting - Class Diagram
image::SyntaxHighlightingClassDiagram.png[]

The `CommandBox`:

* Uses a `CommandDictionary` to search for valid commands.
* Stores a `CommandDetail` for processing the current command in the user input.
* Stores a `PrefixDictionary` containing the required argument details (`PrefixDetails`) for the current command.
* Uses a `CommandBoxUtil` to scan for valid user inputs.
* Returns feedback to the `ResultDisplay`.

The `ResultDisplay` displays the given feedback tas a message in the program.

==== Implementation
The following diagrams show the steps for the different types of syntax highlighting.

Here are some keywords that will be used to explain the implementation:

* A `full command word` is a text that identifies a command.

* An `argument` is a text that contains a `prefix` and a `value`.

** The `prefix` is the text value of a `Prefix` in the Logic component.
** The `value` is all the text following the `prefix`.

* The `preamble` is the text (including whitespaces) between the end of the
`full command word`, and the beginning of the first `argument`.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the limitations of *PlantUML*, some of the diagrams may not appear as expected.

In particular, there are issues with representing alternate paths in *PlantUML* BETA Activity Diagrams

For example:

. They split into multiple diamonds, instead of all originating from the same diamond.
. They do not converge at a single diamond, and instead skips it altogether.
. They cannot join other branches.

In particular, the biggest limitation was the third issue.
To overcome this, you will see multiple end nodes in some of the diagrams.
Please assume that they all converge into a single diamond before reaching the end node.

====

===== Step 1. Highlighting a new input
When a new user input is entered in the `CommandBox`,
the syntax highlighting will be reapplied.

The following _Activity Diagram_ explains how the `full command word` is highlighted,
up until the beginning of the `preamble`.

.Step 1 - Highlighting a new input
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram1.png[]

Here is the purpose of each partition in the above diagram:

* `blank` +
When there is no input,
the `ResultDisplay` should not show anything.

.Blank `ResultDisplay`
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-1-Blank.png[,300]

* `invalid` +
When there is no matching `full command word`,
the `ResultDisplay` should indicate that a wrong command is entered.

.Invalid `full command word`
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-1-Invalid.png[,300]

* `valid` +
When there is a matching `full command word`,
change the highlighting rules for the new command.

* `no_arguments` +
When `full command word` has just been entered,
the `ResultDisplay` should indicate that a correct command has been entered.

.`CommandBox` has no `arguments`
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-1-NoArgs.png[,300]

* `has_arguments` +
After processing the `full command word`,
proceed to step 2. +
+
NOTE: There should be a rake symbol next to the only activity in this partition.

.`CommandBox` has `arguments`
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-1-HasArgs.png[,250]

===== Step 2. Highlighting the preamble
After verifying that the new input has a `full command word`,
the highlighting will also need to be reapplied to the `preamble` and `arguments`.

The following _Activity Diagram_ explains how the `preamble` is highlighted,
up until the beginning of the first `argument`.

.Step 2 - Highlighting the preamble
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram2.png[]

Here is the purpose of each partition in the above diagram:

* `whitespaces` +
Inputs that have trailing whitespaces will be handled separately.

.Trailing whitespace, coloured in blue for this diagram
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-2-Space.png[,250]

* `many_whitespaces` +
When there are more than two trailing whitespaces,
the `ResultDisplay` should reshow how to use the command.

.Many trailing whitespaces, coloured in blue for this diagram
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-2-ManySpace.png[,400]

* `preamble_error` +
When the input has a `preamble` that the command does not need,
the `ResultDisplay` should indicate that a wrong command is entered.

.Invalid `preamble` in input
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-2-WrongPreamble.png[,350]

* `preamble_end` +
After processing the `preamble`,
proceed to step 3. +
+
NOTE: There should be a rake symbol next to the only activity in this partition.

.Valid `preamble` in input
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-2-RightPreamble.png[,350]

===== Step 3. Highlighting the remaining arguments
After verifying that the `preamble` is valid for the given `full command word`,
the highlighting will need to be reapplied to each `argument` in the remaining user input.

The following _Activity Diagram_ explains how each `argument` is highlighted,
up until end of the user input.

.Step 3 - Highlighting the remaining arguments
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram3.png[]

Here is the purpose of each partition in the above diagram:

* `wrong` +
When the command does not need the given `argument`,
the `ResultDisplay` should reshow how to use the command.

.Wrong `argument` in input
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-3-Wrong.png[,500]

* `invalid` +
When the `argument` cannot have the given `value`,
the `ResultDisplay` should show how to use the `argument`.

.Invalid `argument` in input
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-3-Invalid.png[,500]

* `valid` +
After processing the current `argument`,
the `ResultDisplay` will still show how to use the argument in case the `argument`
can have spaces.

.Valid `argument` in input
image::syntax-highlighting/SH-3-Valid.png[,500]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect #1: Executing the syntax highlighting in real-time
The current implementation reapplies the highlighting whenever the user input changes.
When no input is changed, the program will idle.

In contrast, having an infinite loop can achieve the same highlighting,
but the program cannot idle and will consume memory when in use.

===== Aspect #2: Range of syntax highlighting
The current implementation uses three colours for the syntax highlighting.

The following colours are used:

* `Red` - invalid input
* `Green` - valid input
* `White` - the default font colour for the `CommandBox` input

These colours have been chosen because they are standard signalling colours used in
everyday life. Therefore the user will be familiar with these colour signals without
a need for an explanation.

Valid inputs have been highlighted in order to signal to the user that they have used
the command correctly. An alternative would be to remove this colour though, as having too
many flashing colours may be distracting to the user.
// end::syntaxhighlighting[]

[[Implementation-Filter]]
=== Filter Command

==== Description

Different view has its own designated filter command.

====
* *Student View*, has the `student filter`
* *Session View*, has the `session filter`
* *Claims View*, has the `claims filter`
====

==== Implementation
This section describes the implementation of the `filter` command.

The _Activity diagram_ below summarises what happens when the user executes a `filter` command:

._Activity Diagram_ of the Filter Command
image::FilterCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

The filter feature consists of three main steps:

1. *Validating and parsing* user input

2. Creating a *filtering predicate* from user's input

3. *Updating the filtered* list with the *filtering predicate*

===== Filter under Student View

Students are filtered based on the module code and/or
group code given by the user.

Module code is a compulsory parameter for the user.

The following _Sequence diagram_ shows the sequence of commands that take place between
the `Logic` and `Model` components of the Ta-Tracker when the user enters the command
`student filter m\CS2103T g\G06`. This command will return students from module code `CS2103T`, under group `G06`.

._Sequence Diagram_ for Filter Student Command
image::FilterStudentSequenceDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example scenario where the user enters a command to filter students.

. The user command is passed through the `LogicManager` to `TaTrackerParser`.
`TaTrackerParser` checks the input arguments and identify the String keywords.

. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a type of Student and passes the command
to the `StudentCommandParser`.

. The `StudentCommandParser` sees that the command is a type of filter and passes the
arguments to the `FilterStudentCommandParser`.

. The `FilterStudentCommandParser` creates a `FilterStudentCommand` object
with the relevant keywords.

. `LogicManager` calls `FilterStudentCommand` 's execute method.

. The `FilterStudentCommand` object checks whether any of the keywords given by the user matches the existing
module and/or group.
.. If it doesn't, a `CommandException` is thrown saying that no such students exists.
.. If it does, the `FilterStudentCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

===== Filter under Session View

Sessions can be filtered with the following parameters:

* `d/DATE`
* `m/MODULE CODE`
* `t/SESSION_TYPE`

These parameters can be used alone or together.

The command used to filter sessions has been implemented in a similar way. The main
difference is that the `FilterSessionCommandParser` creates a `SessionPredicate` object.
The `SessionPredicate` object updates the filtered session list by keywords in Model.
The filtered list will then be displayed.

When the user specifies a keyword, sessions that contain the keywords will be filtered and shown to the user.
If none of the keywords supplied by the user appears in any sessions, a `CommandException`
will be shown.

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the functioning of
the `SessionFilter` Command.

.Class Diagram for Filter Session Command
image::FindCommandClassDiagram.png[]

===== Filter under Claims View

The user can only filter the *Claims View* by module code.
When the user enters the command `claims filter m/MODULE_CODE`, claims that contain the module code
will be filtered.

The command used to filter claims is implemented the same way as `SessionFilterCommand`.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Effort

Creating this application was fairly difficult and required a lot of effort from us.

While AB3 deals with only one entity, this application deals with multiple entities.
AB3 contains only `persons`. This application has 3 views to begin with - the *Student View*,
*Session View* and *Claims View*. This is a big change from AB3's UI.

While we were able to refactor `person` into `student`,
we had to create `session`, `group` and `module` from scratch. In addition to that,
we also have a `statistics` window and our `help` window is significantly more appealing
than the AB3 `help` window.

Due to our inexperience with UI work, we had initially planned *Student View* to look
very different. Therefore, the way it was implemented was a little different.
Once we got more familiar with JavaFX, we realised that our initial plan was no longer
feasible and had to change the way *Student View* was implemented and had to add a lot
of supporting methods to allow the UI to work the way it does.

Another challenge we faced was that we were unaware of restrictions regarding timing
in features for the module CS2103 for which this application has been created. Two of
our features that relied on timing that were almost ready had to be scrapped and we
had to look for new features to replace them.
