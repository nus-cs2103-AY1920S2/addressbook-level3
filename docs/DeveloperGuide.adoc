== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-c 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete-c 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

`GraphWindow` is a separate `Stage` from `MainWindow`. `MainWindow` creates a `GraphWindow` through a `graph` command.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FitBizParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding or deleting a client).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying the list of clients or exercise graphs.

Given below is the sequence diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete-c 1")` API call mentioned previously.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-c 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Client` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +

image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save `Client`, `Exercise` and `Schedule` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

// tag::aaron-choo[]

=== Command History --- Aaron Choo

This feature serves to improve the user experience by allowing users to browse and retrieve their previously entered commands using the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrow keys, similar to what most modern CLIs offer.

==== Implementation

This command history mechanism is facilitated by the logic class `CommandHistory`, which controls both the model class `CommandHistoryState` and the storage utility class `StorageReaderWriter`.

===== Behaviour of this feature

The behaviour of this feature has been implemented to mimic most modern CLIs, namely:

. The empty string, `""`, should not be stored in the history
. Commands that are similar to the most recently stored command in the history should not be stored (ie. duplicate commands will not be stored)
. All other user input, be it valid or invalid commands, should be stored
. Number of commands should only be stored up to a well-defined maximum number (100 in this case, for performance reasons discussed in the later section)
. Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] arrow key should browse backwards towards the least recently entered commands
. Pressing the kbd:[&darr;] arrow key should browse forwards towards the most recently entered commands
. The caret position should be at the end of the command string when browsing the history
. Persistent storage of the command history should be supported (ie. a user can quit the app and come back to the same history as his previous usage of the app)

===== How this feature works

Since all user inputs, be it valid or invalid commands, should be stored, and since detection of the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrow keys must occur in the JavaFX's `TextField` class found in `CommandBox`, we have decided to let `CommandBox` directly interact with `CommandHistory`. In other words, `CommandBox` will be responsible for calling `CommandHistory#addToHistory`, `CommandHistory#getNextCommand`, and `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand`. A simplified class diagram of the classes involved in this feature is given below:

.Class Diagram for Command History
image::CommandHistoryClassDiagram.png[]

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution of the classes involved in the class diagram given above for when the user decides to enter the command `list-c` into FitBiz:

.Sequence Diagram for Saving a User Entered Command
image::CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png[]

`CommandBox` simply passes the user input text to `CommandHistory`, which adds this text to the internal list within `CommandHistoryState`, retrieves the full internal list, converts it to a text-based format, and finally asks `FileUtil` to save the text to storage.

===== How the Command History is persisted on storage

Each command that the user enters is essentially just a line of text. We simply use the utility class `FileUtil` to write these lines of text (where each command represents a new line of text) to a text-based file `command.txt`.

Whenever FitBiz first launches, we will then try to open and read from this same `command.txt` file. If no such file exists, an empty new file will be created for use in the future.

==== Design Considerations

In designing the model `CommandHistoryState`, we had to decide on the underlying data structure to store the user's command history. We currently use the Java native `ArrayList<String>`, where each line of command is stored as an individual entry. Another alternative that we have considered is to store the commands in a `LinkedList<String>`:

[options='header', cols="20%h,40%,40%"]
|====================
| Considerations | ArrayList (chosen) | LinkedList
| Time Complexity | Inserting to the list is O(1).

Removal of the first item is O(n).

Retrieval of any item is always O(1). | Inserting to the list is O(1).

Removal of the first/last item is O(1).

Retrieval of an item that is not the first/last item will require traversal of the list and will be more expensive than O(1).
| Ease of Implementation | Indices are concrete numbers and thus, are much easier to manipulate than pointers.

The use of indices are enough to support the retrieval operations needed by this feature and is efficient since retrieval is always O(1).
| Pointers are arguably harder to keep track of and might be more difficult to implement.

A custom linked list (as opposed to just using the native Java `LinkedList`) may have to be developed in order to support the retrieval operations that this feature requires while still keeping the retrieval time complexity to O(1).
|====================

In the interest of saving developement time and better code readability, we decided to use an `ArrayList` to store the commands. Since we have decided to cap the maximum size of the list, should this limit be exceeded, we would then need to remove the first item (or the zeroth index) from the list to free up space. Of course, doing a `remove(0)` on a n-item `ArrayList` will require that all remaining items in the list be reassigned to new indices, and thus incur an O(n) time operation. However, we found out through extensive testing that this causes no observable nor significant lag when the maximum capacity is reached.

Moreover, there is also a need to overwrite the whole storage file `command.txt` whenever this maximum size is reached. Before this maximum size is reached, we can easily append to the existing file the new command that the user has just entered. However, after this limit is exceeded, we must remove the first line stored in `command.txt`, shift all remaining lines up, and then append that new line. Hard disk operations like writing to storage is many order of magnitudes slower than memory operations like the reassignment of indices as discussed above. Since the much larger bottleneck is in the storage, this effectively nullifies the time complexity comparison that a `LinkedList` is faster than an `ArrayList` in removing the first item.

In choosing the maximum size of the command history, we have to take note of some important caveats:

. This number must be small enough to not cause the app to lag when the whole history is being written to storage
. This number must be big enough to satisfy the user

Ultimately, we felt that 100 is a very generous estimate given that a user really only needs the past few commands at any point of time.

=== Command Autocomplete --- Aaron Choo

Similar to the previously mentioned <<Command History --- Aaron Choo, Command History>> feature, this feature also serves to improve the user experience by allowing users to press the kbd:[Tab] key to autocomplete their partially entered commands.

[[command-history-implementation]]
==== Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the logic found in the `Autocomplete` class. Before we dive into the implementation, let us first define what _unambiguous_ and _ambiguous_ commands are:

[options='header']
|===
| Unambiguous Commands | Ambiguous Commands
| Can uniquely identify a single command using the sequence of letters that the user has entered | Cannot uniquely identify a single command using the sequence of letters that the user has entered
|===

[TIP]
For example, assume we only have 3 commands in our app, `add-c`, `add-e`, and `edit-c`. If the user enters `e` and tries to autocomplete the command using kbd:[Tab], we say that this is an unambiguous command since clearly, `edit-c` can be uniquely identified by `e`. If instead, the user enters `a` and presses kbd:[Tab] to autocomplete the command, we say that this is an ambiguous command, since both `add-c` and `add-e` are possible choices.

[[command-history-behaviour]]
===== Behaviour of this feature

Again, this feature has also been implemented to mimic most modern CLIs, namely:

. Any unambiguous commands should be immediately completed upon pressing of the kbd:[Tab] key
. Any ambiguous commands should be completed up till the longest common prefix of all similar commands
** Using the ambiguous command example in the introduction above, when the user enters `a` and presses kbd:[Tab], the autocompletion should return `add-` (the longest common prefix of `add-e` and `add-c`) to the user
. A list of all similar commands should be presented to the user should he try to autocomplete an ambiguous command
. [[command-history-behaviour-4]]Pressing kbd:[Tab] when the command has already been completed will bring the user's caret to the next prefix delimitter (`/` in our case) with wraparound

===== How the Trie data structure works

Since Java does not provide a native Trie data structure, we had to implement our own version of it. Moreover, Java also does not allow methods with multiple return values, and thus, we had to create a wrapper class `SimilarWordsResult` to store the multiple results returned by `Trie#listAllSimilarWords`. In this section, we shall take a more in depth look at the overall implementation of this data structure.

We first look at the `Node` class provided in the same package which `Trie` relies on. Each `Node` object should contain the following attributes:

* The parent node (`null` if the node is the root of the Trie)
* The current letter it represents
* The children nodes (if any)
* A boolean to know whether that node represents a completed word

Since each node stores with it their parent node pointer, we can easily construct the word represented by a node by recursively building the word up letter by letter until the root is reached. This is implemented in `Node#constructWord`, as shown here:

```java
public String constructWord() {
      if (isRoot()) {
            return EMPTY_STRING;
      }
      return parent.constructWord() + getLetter();
}
```

Now, let us discuss about how we implemented `Trie` to support the <<command-history-behaviour, behaviours discussed above>> by first looking at `Trie#getLongestPrefixNode`. This method takes in an argument `word` and returns in 3 distinct cases:

. If the argument `word` matches no words currently in the `Trie`: `null`
. If the argument `word` is unambiguous: the `Node` whose constructed word (using `Node#constructWord`) is the longest word contained in `Trie` that can be formed from `word`
. If the argument `word` is ambiguous: the `Node` whose constructed word is the longest common prefix of all words similar to `word` contained in `Trie`

[TIP]
Refer to <<autocomplete-activity-diagram>> given in the next section for the complete sequence of the key decisions.

Let us move on to `Trie#listAllSimilarWords` which makes use of the `Node` found by `Trie#getLongestPrefixNode`. Cases 1 and 2 discussed above are relatively trivial and we shall not discuss about how they are handled in `Trie#listAllSimilarWords`. For case 3, in order for us to find all the similar words, we have chosen to use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach, starting the search from the `Node` returned by `Trie#getLongestPrefixNode`, as shown here:

```java
Node subtrie = getLongestPrefixNode(word);
ArrayList<String> similarWords = new ArrayList<>();

Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();

stack.push(subtrie);

while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
      Node current = stack.pop();
      if (current.isWordEnd()) {
            similarWords.add(current.constructWord());
      } else {
            stack.addAll(current.getChildren().values());
      }
}
```

[NOTE]
The choice of a DFS approach as opposed to a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach is arbitrary, both should work as expected.

===== How this feature works

Similar to <<Command History --- Aaron Choo, Command History>>, this feature also relies heavily on the UI class `CommandBox`, and thus we have decided to let `CommandBox` interact with `Autocomplete` directly. A simplified class diagram of the classes involved is shown here:

.Simplified Class Diagram for Autocomplete
image::CommandAutocompleteClassDiagram.png[]

In the following sequence diagram, we follow the execution for when the user tries to autocomplete his partially entered command `gra` (which, in the current application, is an unambiguous command, and will result in the full completion of the `graph` command as well as its prefixes):

.Simplified Sequence Diagram for Command Autocomplete
image::CommandAutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

`CommandBox` retrieves the user input command and caret position from the `TextField`, and calls the `execute` method from `Autocomplete` with these information. This `execute` method (shown and explained in full in the next sequence diagram) creates an `AutocompleteResult` object and returns this to `CommandBox`, which retrieves all the information required and sets the `TextField` and `ResultDisplay` accordingly.

.Sequence Diagram for the Autocomplete#execute Method
image::CommandAutocompleteSequenceDiagramRef.png[]

Within the `execute` method, `Autocomplete` calls the `listAllSimilarWords` method from `Trie` with the user input text. `Trie`, which would already have all the commands stored, finds the longest prefix node, calls the `constructWord` method from this node, and checks if this node represents the end of a completed word. Since it is indeed a completed word, `Trie` immediately creates a `SimilarWordsResult` object to store these information and returns it to `Autocomplete`. Then, `Autocomplete` retrieves these information, realises that it is dealing with an unambiguous command, and constructs the corresponding prefixes. It then creates a `AutocompleteResult` object to store all the information that `CommandBox` requires, and finally returns this object to `CommandBox`.

Lastly, in order to explain the key decisions that this feature does at each step starting from the point where the user presses kbd:[Tab], we have provided the following activity diagram:

[[autocomplete-activity-diagram]]
.Activity Diagram for the Autocomplete Logic
image::CommandAutocompleteActivityDiagram.png[]

This feature currently only supports autocompletion of _commands_ and _prefixes_, and not other fields/parameters like names and addresses that have been used by the user before. Implicitly, since all commands defined in FitBiz do not have empty spaces in them, this allows us to easily determine when to allow users to press kbd:[Tab] to get to the next prefix (<<command-history-behaviour-4, behaviour 4>>): by simply checking for the presence of white spaces from the trimmed user input.

==== Design Considerations

As discussed in the <<command-history-implementation, implementation section>>, we have decided to use a Trie data structure. Of course, we have also considered other much simpler alternatives like simply storing all available commands in a native Java `List`. A quick summary of the pros and cons is given here:

[options='header', cols="20%h,40%,40%"]
|===
| Considerations | Trie (chosen) | List
| Time Complexity | Searching if a word exists is O(n), where n is the number of letters in the word to search for.

Finding the longest common prefix of an ambiguous command is O(n), where n is the number of letters in the original word.
| Searching if a word exists is O(nm), where n is the number of letters in the word to search for, and m is the number of words in the list.

Finding the longest common prefix of an ambiguous command is not linear with n and m.
| Ease of Implementation | Initial development might be more difficult; developers might not be familiar with this data structure as it is not as common.

Custom class means that additional, custom logic can be easily added.
| Much faster initial development.

Custom logic cannot be easily added.
|===

As such, the choice of implementing our own Trie data structure is obvious. As this app grows bigger in the forseeable future, the number of commands as well as the number of things we would want to autocomplete would increase. Overall, we felt that the Trie data structure will scale much better as compared to a List.

Exchanging some initial development time for future scalability of our app will ensure that we, or future developers, do not end up wasting time refactoring what could have been done in the first place. Moreover, the Trie data structure is much more effective and computationally inexpensive in finding the longest common prefix of all ambiguous commands. The same cannot be said when using a List.

Also, since we have implemented our own Trie data structure, it would also allow more custom logic to be added later, and allow more creative freedom with respect to the features that we, or future developers would want to add. For example, future version of this application might want to also include the autocompletion of frequently used parameters by the user.

=== Scheduling for a Client --- Ng Ming Liang
This feature allows for a user to assign a weekly schedule to a client. Timings are represented in the 24-hour format `HHmm`. Each client can have none or multiple schedules that do not have overlapping timings. Multiple clients are allowed to have overlapping timings with each other.

==== Implementation
This scheduling mechanism is facilitated by `ScheduleList`, which is a wrapper class for an `ArrayList` of `Schedule` objects. Each `Client` contains one `ScheduleList` attribute to keep track of all `Schedule` assigned to it. If there are no assigned `Schedule` for the `Client`, then the `ScheduleList` contains an empty `ArrayList` of `Schedule`.

`Schedule` comprises three attributes:

* `Day`

* `StartTime`

* `EndTime`

`Day` wraps the enum `DayEnum.Weekday` and represents the day of the week the schedule takes place on.
`StartTime` and `EndTime` represent the start time and end time of the schedule in the "HHmm" format respectively. The relations between these classes are shown in the class diagram below.

image::ScheduleClassDiagram.png[]

These attributes are bounded by these characteristics:

* Each `Client` can only contain unique `Schedule`, that is, there are no overlaps in timings between any two `Schedule` in the `ScheduleList`. This is ensured by `ScheduleCommandParser#checkIfOverlaps()`

* Overlapping timings between the `Schedule` of different `Client` is allowed

* The maximum timeframe between `StartTime` and `EndTime` is from `0000` to `2359`

* `StartTime` cannot be later than `EndTime`

* `Day` can only take up the 7 values of the week (MON/TUE/WED/THU/FRI/SAT/SUN)

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution for when the user decides to enter the command `schedule 1 day/mon st/1100 et/1200` into FitBiz:

image::ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
In designing this feature, we had to consider the alternative ways in which we can choose to store the information of a schedule. One option of storing the relevant information (day, start, end times) for a schedule was simply to concatenate these values into a single String, for example, `"monday-1100-1200"`. However, we found that this did not exploit the desirable principles of Object-Oriented Programming. As respective sanity checks had to be done for the day
and timing, wrapping each of these properties into their wrapper classes allowed for better modularity and organisation of these attributes. For example, `Day#isValidDay` handles the validation of the input for day and `Time#isValidTimingFormat` handles the validation of time.

Considerations also then had to be made for how to contain multiple `Schedule`. The current implementation uses the `ArrayList` data structure to hold multiple `Schedule`. Other considered alternative for `ScheduleList` was `HashSet`.
[options='header']
|====================
| Data Structure | Pros and Cons
| ArrayList |
*Pros*: Elements can be sorted and retrieved in ascending order

*Cons*: Does not ensure that its elements are unique
| HashSet |
*Pros*: Does not allow duplicate values

*Cons*: Does not return elements in order
|====================

As the nature of the schedule panel was to display a sorted collection of `Schedule`, we chose `ArrayList` as the underlying data structure. In addition, we also harnessed the capability of the `HashSet` to ensure no overlaps between `Schedule` within each `Client`, which is implemented by `ScheduleCommandParser#checkIfOverlaps`.

=== Exercise Feature --- Yong Jie

This feature allows users to record the exercises done by a client. The exercises are displayed in a table form, after the `view-c` command is called.

==== Implementation

===== Implementation of Exercise class

The `Exercise` class is facilitated by the `UniqueExerciseList`, which is a wrapper class for an `ObservableList` of `Exercise` objects. Each Client contains one `UniqueExerciseList` attribute to keep track of all `Exercises` the client has.

`Exercise` comprises five attributes:

. `ExerciseName`
. `ExerciseDate`
. `ExerciseReps`
. `ExerciseWeight`
. `ExerciseSets`

All instances of `Exercise` of a client will be contained in the client's `UniqueExerciseList`. There is an additional class `PersonalBest` which is also associated to `Exercise`. It is omitted and will discuss in (...) section due to its high significance. Below shows a UML class diagram which shows `Exercise` class interactions.

image::ExerciseClassDiagram.png[]

An important point to note about our implementation of `Exercise` is the method, `isSameExercise()`. We will consider two `Exercise` as the same if `isSameExercise()` returns true.

. Executes when adding a new `Exercise` to client's `UniqueExerciseList`. This includes `add-e` and `edit-e`.
. Checks if the new `Exercise` is the same with an existing instance of `Exercise` in the client's `UniqueExerciseList`.
. Two `Exercises` are the same does not mean that they are equal.
Two `Exercise` are equal only if *all* attributes are equal.

Below shows an object diagram of two `Exercises` that will return true for `isSameExercise()`.

image::IsSameExerciseObjectDiagram.png[]

The two `Exercise` only have different values in `ExerciseSets` but equal values in:

. `ExerciseName`
. `ExerciseDate`
. `ExerciseReps`
. `ExerciseWeight`

This implementation is chosen as we felt that the user should increment the value in `ExerciseSets` in the existing `Exercise`. We followed the same idea as in the real life context. Exercises with the same reps and weight can be grouped together as sets.

We do consider that the user might want to record the two instances separately as it might be done at different periods of the day. In the future, when adding a same `Exercise`, we can implement it such that the sets value of the exising `Exercise` gets incremented automatically instead of showing an error. For now, this implementation keeps the exercise table neat and compact for the user.

===== Execution flow of Exercise Commands

The exercise commands edits the client's `UniqueExerciseList`. Currently, there are 3 exercise commands.

. `add-e` : Adds an exercise to a client
. `edit-e` : Edits a client's exercise
. `delete-e` : Deletes a client's exercise

The commands follow a similar execution flow as other commands.

image::ExerciseCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

. The `FitBizParser` will create the associated exercise command parser. e.g. `AddExerciseCommandParser`
. Using `ParserUtil`, the parser will extract attribute details from the input and create the `Command`. e.g. `AddExerciseCommand`
. The exercise `Command` will be executed and modify the client's `UniqueExerciseList`.
    .. Exceptions like no client being viewed and invalid input are thrown here.
. The change will be reflected in the exercise table in GUI.
. Result box will display success message for the `Command`.

===== Adding an exercise to UniqueExerciseList

When adding a new `Exercise` to `UniqueExerciseList`, it is important which index it is added. This is such that the exercises for the client will be displayed in descending chronological order in the table after a `view-c` command. `TableView` provides sorting for dates. However, having `TableView` to do the sorting would result in mismatch of indexes of the exercises in the `UniqueExerciseList` and in the `TableView`. This will result in problems when using exercise commands that specifies an index like `delete-e`.

To address this problem, a custom insertion sort has been written in UniqueExerciseList, under the `addToSorted(Exercise)` method. This method will do a single pass of the internal list to insert the element at the correct position. This assumes that the internal list is initially sorted (which it should be, since reading from storage will do an initial sort on it).

We will use an example of a `add-e` command to illustrate the execution of `addToSorted(Exercise)`. Consider an instance where user inputs `add-e n/pushup d/12-12-2011 reps/20`. The sequence diagram below shows the execution flow when the `AddExerciseCommand` is executed. Details of exception thrown are omitted as this is a postive instance and for simplicity.

image::AddExerciseCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

`AddExerciseCommand` checks if there is an client being viewed. For this instance, we will consider the positive case where indeed there is a client being viewed. `AddExerciseCommand` will retrieve the client being viewed from the `Model` so that details like the existing exercise list of the client can be obtained. The sequence diagram illustrates the execution flow of `addToSorted(Exercise)` to obtain details of the `Exercise` being added and exising `Exercise` in `UniqueExerciseList`.

image::AddExerciseCommandSequenceDiagramPart2.png[]

`UniqueExerciseList` loops through the exercises in the list. and calls `getExerciseDate()` and `getExerciseName()`. The `LocalDate` and exercise name in `String` type are then used for comparision. The sequence diagram below illustrates the conditional checks during the comparision.

image::AddExerciseCommandSequenceDiagramPart3.png[]

The conditional checks are such that `UniqueExerciseList` maintain sorted by descending chronological order, followed by alphabetical order for exercises with the same dates.

Below shows a code snippet of the conditional checks in `addToSorted(Exercise)`.

`Arrays.sort()` can be used to sort the exercises in `UniqueExerciseList` after every addition. However, the worse case time complexity of `Arrays.sort()` is `O(nlogn)`. This custom insertion sort will guarantee an `O(n)` time complexity to insert the new `Exercise` correctly. This is as efficient as it gets as any insertion will already incur an O(n) time complexity to first check if the internal list contains the same exercise. It is important to keep the time complexity low as clients can have many exercises.

==== Design Considerations

This section explains the our design considerations and analysis for the storage of exercises.

[options='header']
[cols="3,2,2,2"]
|====================
| | Store exercises with client and all clients in one JSON file (chosen) | Store all exercises into a separate JSON file | Store exercises with client but one JSON for each client

| Ease of retrieving / storing
| Easy to link the exercises to the client
| Hard to link the exercises to the client
| Hard to identify which JSON file is for which client

| Separation of data
| Does not keep client and exercise data separate
| Keep client data separate from exercise data
| Does not keep client and exercise data separate +

Might have too many JSON files, one for each client

| Size limit of JSON files
| High chances of having one large JSON file and potentially exceed the size limit of a JSON file
| Low chances of exceeding the size limit of a JSON file
| Low chances of exceeding the size limit of a JSON file

| Separation of concerns
| Non-separate code for reading/storing exercises and clients data
| Separate code for reading/storing exercises and clients data
| Non-separate ode for reading/storing exercises and clients data

|====================

We decided to use the first approach of storing the exercises with the associated client and have all the clients data in one JSON file. By code wise, each `JsonAdaptedClient` will have a list of `JsonAdaptedExercise`.

image::ClientExerciseStorageClassDiagram.png[]

We want to keep the implementation of reading and storing of data simple. The first approach is the most simple. When reading the data, it removes the need to associate the exercises to the client. A client might potentially have a large amount of exercises, resulting in the reading process to be extremely slow. Therefore, a bad user experience.

Moreover, storing the exercise data from client data does not provide any performance benefits. Due to time constraints, we decided that the application should store all the data everytime it closes. This is regardless if the particular exercise or client data has been changed. Having to keep track of which data is edited and only overwrite those data would greatly increase the complexity of the application. Therefore, keeping exercises data separate from client data would be unnecessary and provide little additional functionality/benefits to the user.

Lastly, we foresee that it is improbable for the data size of both clients and exercises to exceed the maximum size limit of a JSON file. With the target user in mind, it is unlikely that he will have an enormous amount of clients. The application is meant to be used by a single user and not an organisation. Even though each client might have many exercises, the information of each exercise is relatively small. For now, collectively, the client and exercise data is unlikely to exceed the JSON size limit. We might consider to have multiple JSON files if the data size gets too big in future versions.

Indeed, `JsonAdaptedClient` having a list of `JsonAdaptedExercise` would violate separation of concerns. `JsonAdaptedClient` is now in charge of the client's information and the exercises. However, we felt that the benefits outweighted the costs and proceeded with the first choice.

=== Personal Best --- Li Zi Ying

This feature allows the users (ie. gym managers) to view the personal bests of exercises done by a client. This information is displayed in a table form, after the command `view-c INDEX` is called.

==== Implementation

The personal best feature is facilitated by the model `PersonalBest`, and the logic behind it is in `PersonalBestFinder`. The behaviour of this feature determines the personal best of each exercise done by the client based on these considerations:

. If the `ExerciseWeight` attribute is recorded in the `Exercise`, then the `ExerciseWeight` is used as comparison
. If there is no `ExerciseWeight` recorded in the `Exercise`, then `ExerciseReps` will be used as comparison
. If neither of `ExerciseWeight` and `ExerciseReps` are recorded into the `Exercise`, then this particular exercise will not be put into the Exercise Personal Best table
.. However, if the another `Exercise` of the same name is added in the future with `ExerciseWeight` and/or `ExerciseReps` specified, then the personal best of this exercise will still be calculated and shown in the Exercise Personal Best table
. Note that `ExerciseSets`, although an attribute of the `Exercise` model, is not considered when checking for `PersonalBest` as the number of sets of an exercise does not contribute to a personal best record

A simplified class diagram of the classes involved in this feature is given below:

.Simplified Class Diagram for Personal Best
image::PersonalBestClassDiagram.png[]

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution for when the user decides to enter the command `view-c` into FitBiz:

.Sequence Diagram of the View#execute Method for Personal Best
image::PersonalBestSequenceDiagram.png[]

The explanation for the sequence diagram is as follows: when the user inputs `view-c`, `add-e`, `edit-c` or `delete-c`, `PersonalBestFinder#generateAndSetPersonalBest` is called, taking the client currently in view as the parameter. `PersonalBestFinder#generateAndSetPersonalBest` then retrieves client's list of exercises using `Client#getExerciseList` and creates a new `HashMap`, where the `key` is `ExerciseName` and the `value` is `Exercise`. Then the personal bests of each exercise of the client in view are generated using the above considerations. Finally the list of personal bests is set using `PersonalBest#setPersonalBest`.

==== Design Considerations

In designing this feature, we had to decide on the placement of the `PersonalBest` class in the model to comply with the OOP standards. Currently, the `PersonalBest` model has a whole-part relationship with `Client`, with `Client` being the whole and `PersonalBest` being a part of `Client`. The alternative is to consider `PersonalBest` as a part of `Exercise` instead.

[options='header']
.Table of Design Considerations
|====================
| |  Put `PersonalBest` as a part of `Client`(Chosen) | Put `PersonalBest` as a part of `Exercise`
| *Adhering to OOP standards (Coupling and Cohesion)* | Increases cohesion as it logically makes more sense, currently each client has a list of exercises to themselves, and thus each client should also have a list of `PersonalBest` of each of these exercises to themselves |  Increases coupling between the logic and model as every time the commands `view-c`, `add-e`, `edit-e` and `delete-e` are called, the personal best table has to be updated, a new `PersonalBest` object has to be created. Then the `Client` will have to be dependent on this `PersonalBest` object created in the logic component, which causes unnecessary dependencies and higher coupling
| *Ease of Implementation* | Might have significant conflicts as the `Client` model is changed to include one more attribute | Easier to implemention as methods related to `PersonalBest` is kept under `Exercise` model and separate from `Client` data and methods, so no refactoring is needed

|====================

We decided to use the first approach of placing `PersonalBest` as a part of `Client` instead of `Exercise`. There are multiple reasons for our choice as mentioned below.

We want to maintain the OOP structure of the program. Logically, the personal best should belong to the client as the list of exercises belongs to the client. As the list of exercises is unique to every client, the personal best should also be so. We also do not want to increase coupling of the program as mentioned in the table above.

Moreover, even though personal best is generated using the list of exercises in the client, it can be instantiated even without an exercise list. Therefore it does not require the exercise class to exist and does not have a whole-part relationship with exercise. Coupling will also be increased as the client will be relying on the exercise class to generate the personal best. Therefore, the final choice was to place the personal best under client, with every client having their own personal best attribute.

This personal best feature also leads into the `Graph` feature, which will be discussed in the next section, where we plot a graph of the client's progress of a specified exercise.

=== Graph --- Li Zi Ying

This feature allows users to see the progress graph of the current client in view. The user has to specify the exercise name, the y-axis (either weights or reps), the start date and the end date. There has to be existing exercises in the client's exercise list for the specified axis and time period for the graph to be plotted, if no graph can be plotted, an error will be thrown.

==== Implementation

The graph mechanism is faciliated by the model class `Graph`, which contains the details of the graph. These include `ExerciseName`, `Axis`, `StartDate` and `EndDate`. The figure below is a UML class diagram to illustrate the `Graph` model.

.Simplified Class Diagram for Graph
image::GraphClassDiagram.png[]

These attributes are bounded by these characteristics:
. `ExerciseName` can only be alphanumeric characters
. `Axis` can either be `reps` or `weight` only, case insensitive (`sets` are not considered due to the same reasoning in the above section)
. Earliest `StartDate` possible can only be one year before the current date and cannot be after `EndDate`. `StartDate` also cannot be a future date
. Earliest `EndDate` possible can only be one year before the current date and cannot be before `StartDate`. `EndDate` also cannot be a future date

Here is an activity diagram displaying the steps taken when FitBiz receives a user input for the `graph` command:

.Activity Diagram for Graph Command
image::GraphCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

The behaviour of this feature determines the graph plotted of the exercise specified based on these considerations:

. If there is no such exercise with the matching `ExerciseName` in the client's exercise list from the specified `StartDate` to `EndDate`, then the graph cannot be plotted
. If the `Axis` input is `reps` and the exercise specified does not have any reps input withint the `StartDate` to `EndDate`, then the graph cannot be plot
. If the `Axis` input is `weight` and the exercise specified does not have any weight input within the `StartDate` to `EndDate`, then the graph cannot be plot
. If all of the above are fulfilled (ie. there is at least one valid exercise with the matching `ExerciseName` and has weight/reps input depending on the `Axis` specified), then the graph will be plotted, with each exercise in chronological order

The flow of the program is illustrated using the sequence diagram below:

.Sequence Diagram for Graph Command
image::GraphSequenceDiagram.png[]

The explanation is as follows: when the user inputs `graph` with all relevant arguments input correctly, a new `GraphCommand()` is created, taking the newly created `Graph` object as parameter.

`GraphCommand#execute()` then retrieves the exercise list from the client currently in view and checks if there is at least one exercise with a matching exercise name. If there is no exercise to plot, then an error `GraphCommand.MESSAGE_EXERCISE_NOT_IN_LIST` will be thrown. Next, the list of exercises to be plot will be generated using `Graph#generateGraphList()`. Once again, there will be a sanity check to see if the list size is zero, which means that no graph cannot be plotted.

==== Design Considerations

In designing this feature, we had to decide on the implementation of certain classes like `Axis` to comply with the OOP standards of Abstraction.

[options='header']
.Table of Design Considerations
|====================
| |  Create enum class `Axis Type`(Chosen) | Check for `Axis` value using raw types
| *Adhering to OOP standards (Abstraction)* | Increases level of abstraction as there are only two different types of axis that can be chosen |  Less abstraction and increases complexity as we will have to check for the equality of the axis type using the equality check for the `String` raw type
| *Ease of Implementation* | Requires some refactoring to include `AxisType` class and the relevant getter methods | Easier to implemention as no extra classes or methods are needed, so no refactoring is needed

|====================

We decided to use the approach of abstracting the axis types away into `AxisType` enum class. As the graph implementation will require a substantial amount of equality checks, especially for the attributes of `Graph` to make sure that we are drawing the correct graph for the user. As such equality checks are made, it makes it difficult to keep checking `String` equality as regular data types like `String` would allow invalid values to be assigned to a variable.

As our axis values can only be `REPS`, `WEIGHT` or `NA`, we can check for each case using the switch case method instead of checking for equality using raw types. This is also much more efficient than using multiple if-else statements. For example, in the code snippet below, the method `fillSeries()` uses switch case statements to add data values depending on the `AxisType`.

.Code snippet
[source, java]
----
    private void fillSeries() {
        switch (axisType) {
        case REPS:
            fillRepsSeries();
            yAxis.setLabel("Reps");
            break;
        case WEIGHT:
            fillWeightSeries();
            yAxis.setLabel("Weight");
            break;
        default:
        }
    }
----

Moreover, to keep in line with the OOP standards, we decided that it will be better to abstract away data types like `AxisType` into its separate class instead of storing it as a raw type in `Axis`. This ensures the code quality of our program and reduces complexity (especially in terms of equality checking as mentioned above) by abstracting away the more complex details into classes of a lower level. The consideration of abstracting details away is also used for creating `StartDate` and `EndDate` classes as attributes of `Graph`, instead of using the Java in-built `LocalDate`.

By considering the above two factors, despite having to put in the extra effort to create a new `AxisType` class and thus requiring extra methods like getters and setters, we decided to move with the approach of creating the `AxisType` enum class and refactor to accomodate for the additional data type.

=== Filtering the list of clients --- Toh Ker Wei
This feature allows users to filter the list of clients by specifying the `Tag` or `Sport` of the clients they want to view.

==== Implementation
This filtering mechanism is facilitated by `TagAndSportContainsKeywordsPredicate`, that implements `Predicate<Client>` which is a wrapper class for a boolean. `FilterCommand` is associated with `Model` is responsible for calling `Model#updateFilteredClientList` based on `TagAndSportContainsKeywordsPredicate`. `TagAndSportContainsKeywordsPredicate` will call `test` on `Client` to check if the clients 'Tag' and `Sport` contains all the keyword. the relations between these classes are shown in the class diagram below.

image::FilterClassDiagram.png[]

To further elaborate,
`TagAndSportContainsKeywordsPredicate` contains 2 booleans:

1. `hasTag`: evaluates if the client has all the `Tag` specified
2. `hasSport`: evaluates if the client has all the `Sport` specified

If there is no keyword specified for either `Tag` or `Sport`, the corresponding boolean will return `true`. There must be at least 1 keyword specified, regardless of whether it is a `Tag` or `Sport`. `TagAndSportContainsKeywordsPredicate` will then evaluate and return the logical addition of `hasTag` and `hasSport`.

In the following sequence diagram, we will be tracing the execution of the command `filter t/obese s/swim` entered by the user.

image::FilterSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
[options='header']
.Table of Design Considerations
|====================
| |Using separate booleans to check for `Tag` and `Sport` keywords  (Chosen) | Using one boolean to check for all keywords
| Ease of Implementation | Checks for client's `Tags` and `Sports` containing keywords can be done separately ensuring that individual results are correct before combining them |Simpler logic but errors are more difficult to pinpoint to either `TAG` or `SPORT`
| Ease of Expanding Feature | Easier to add new parameters to filter since a separate check will be done before combining with the result of previous checks | Boolean conditions can get very complex and logical error will be prone to occur

|====================

We decided to use the first approach of checking if the client contains `Tag` specified and `Sport` specified separately.

Firstly, by separating the checks for each attributes, a correct implementation of checking `Tag` against the keywords will allow us to easily duplicate the logic to be done for `Sport`. This makes the code easier to debug as we can simply check the hasAttribute boolean to see if it gives the correct value.

Secondly, separating the checks for each attributes will allow us to add attributes of different types stored in different data structure easier. We could simply add another check on the attribute against the keyword specified then do a logical addition of the result against the others.

Therefore, as we foresee us adding more attributes to be filtered increasing the need to ensure logical correctness, the first approach is the most ideal.

=== Viewing the information of a client --- Toh Ker Wei
This feature allows users to view the information of a specific client using his `INDEX` in the clients list. Information displayed includes additional information of the client, exercises done and his personal best of exercises done.

==== Implementation
The view client's information feature is primarily facilitated by the model `Client`. The details for list of exercises done and personal best will be discussed in section 3.7 and not be covered here. The client's `INDEX` in the clients list will be used to identify and retrieve his information. Additionally, only when a client's information is being viewed, graph of his exercises can be plotted.

In the following sequence diagram, we will be tracing the execution when the user enters the command `view-c 3`

image::ViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

[options='header']
|====================
| | Choose client to view based on `INDEX` (Chosen)| Choose client to view based on `NAME`
| Adhering to Single Responsibilities Principle| `view-c` only has to retrieve and display the client based on `INDEX` entered
| `view-c` has to retrieve clients with the same name and use `INDEX` to specify the client to view
|Ease of Implementation | Easier to implement as `MODEL` only needs to be accessed once | Harder to implement as `view-c` needs to return a list of clients with the same name before using `INDEX` to specify the client

|====================

We decided to use the first approach of using the client's `INDEX` to view his information.

Firstly, as the client's `INDEX` is unique, `view-c` will only be responsible for retrieving and displaying the client's information and will not need to resolve clients with the same names.

Secondly, for clients with the same name, `INDEX` qill be used to specify the client to be view. This causes extra work for the implementation. Furthermore, in cases where users manage many clients and some with same names, there are functions like find and filter which allow users to scope the clients list and easily find the desired client's `INDEX`.

Therefore, viewing a client by his `INDEX` minimises the responsibility of the command and will not need to resolve conflicting clients and is the most ideal.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI without the client view populated with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Command autocomplete

. Unambiguous, single command found

.. Test case: type `gr` into the command box and press kbd:[Tab] +
   Expected: command box shows completed `graph n/ a/ sd/ ed/` command, with the caret position right after `n/`. Result box shows the `graph` command usage.
.. Test case: type `add-e` into the command box and press kbd:[Tab] +
   Expected: command box shows completed `add-e n/ d/ reps/ ew/ sets/` command, with the caret position right after `n/`. Result box shows the `add-e` command usage.

. Ambiguous, multiple commands found

.. Test case: type `a` into the command box and press kbd:[Tab] +
   Expected: command box shows longest common prefix `add-`, with the caret position at the end of the line. Result box indicates and lists that `add-e` and `add-c` commands are found.

. No valid commands found

.. Test case: type `Fitbiz!` into the command box and press kbd:[Tab] +
   Expected: command box and caret positions does not change. Result box indicates that no commands were found.

. Prefix traversal when commands are completed with white spaces

.. Test case: type `graph n/ a/ sd/ ed/` into the command box and press kbd:[Tab] +
   Expected: caret position travels around all the `/` with wraparound.
.. Test case: type `///` into the command box and press kbd:[Tab] +
   Expected: command box and caret positions does not change. Result box indicates that no commands were found. This is similar to 3, no valid commands found.

. Commands with white spaces but without `/`

.. Test case: type `i <3 2103` into the command box and press kbd:[Tab] +
   Expected: command box and caret positions does not change. Result box does not change. Basically nothing happens.

=== Deleting a client

. Deleting a client while all clients are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all clients using the `list` command. Multiple clients in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No client is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
