== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[width="65%",cols="25%,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Class | Definition
| LandingPage     | First display page for user
| Command controller | Parses and executes user command
| Search          | Class that handles individual user search query
| Generate Report | Class that generate PDF reports
| Model           | Class that handles modelling & message format
| Storage         | Class that handles all data access
| ??              | Placeholder for whatever we don't know needs to be there.

[[Use-case-diagram]]
== Use case diagram
.Use case diagram for our ContactTracing app

The functionalities for our application are highlighted in the use case diagram.
This diagram was enacted based on premilinary brainstorming of our user stories.

=== Class definitions

We created the following classes (and their relationship) in order to fulfil our use cases in <<Use-case-diagram>>.

`ContactTracingMainApp` Entry point to launch our contact tracing application

`AppUiManager` Handles rendering information to user and response to user input

`AppMainWindow` Class that sets FXML stage and component arrangements. The class consists of
a `CommandBox` for receiving user input , a `ResultDisplay` for displaying feedback to user
and `BluetoothPingPanel` for rendering search information.

`BluetoothPingPanel` will render different information types, depending on user command.

* `BluetoothPingSummaryPanel` renders all information regarding `BluetoothPing` model
* `PersonSummaryPanel` renders all information regarding `Person` model

`AppLogicManager` handles all backend logic for the application.
It relies on `DaoRouter` to retrieve relevant in-memory storage data.

At present, we only have two kinds of `InMemoryStorage` classes. All `InMemoryStorage` classes
have their data loaded at runtime. Any modifications to the data will not be presisted, in accordance
with project requirements for no internet connectivity.

* `BluetoothPingStorageAccess` stores all collected `BluetoothPing` traces
* `UserStorageAccess` stores all `Person` objects

`CommandRouter` routes user requests to relevant `Command` class types, which form the core
execution logic of the system.

Each `Command` class uses `Conditions` / `Aggregators` classes to drive the implementation of certain logics
and generate PDF report with `ReportGenerator`. For example, we can have a `FilterDangerCommand` first using
the `GroupByIDPairsAggregators` to merge and count all collect `BluetoothPings` based on their User ID pairs,
then pass it through the `DangerConditions` class to infer which User ID Pairs have had too much contact time.
Later, the search result will be passed to  `DangerReportGenerator` to generate report with a table showing
all danger ID pairs with summary message. To generate a report, `RecordReader` will be used to illustrate the
given search result and pass data points to `PDFWriter` to generate a PDF file with summary on records.

The return of a successfully executed command is an `AppMessage` class which signals to `AppUiManager`
how the results should be rendered to the user. The return result of the execution command displayed to
the user includes two parts: the execution message and the corresponding instances extracted from the
storage.

== How the architecture components interact with each other

=== User Launches App

.When user issues an instruction to the application
image::SequenceDiagram.png[]

When the user launches the application, his request goes through a series of classes
as illustrated in the figure above.

=== Retrieving command / storage

.Logic for route(request / command) for Command Router
image::CommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Figure illustrates how a command is chosen based on a user defined *COMMAND_WORD*.

The exact concepts can be applied for selecting the data access object we want to use.

.Logic for route(request / command) for Dao Router
image::DaoRouterSequenceDiagram.png[]
Here, the `DaoRouter` infers the type of data access needed by looking at class `AppCommand`.

Routing is done based on whether the `AppCommand` class inherits from the list of avaible storage access classes.
At present, we only have `BluetoothPingStorageAccess` or `UserStorageAccess`.

== The activities in using this app
image::ActivityDiagram.png[]

ActivityDiagram illustrate the precession handling the input command. For all kinds of commands from
the command box, firstly, we deal with the invalid command and exit command. All invalid commands
will get a "Unknown command" error
and the App will be closed with an `exit` command. Then all other valid commands are
be parsed and three different types of operator are used to solve the commands according to
the command type. The command execution result will be shown in the UIWindow.

== Models

All our models are stored and loaded at runtime in memory.

`BluetoothPings` class contains the following fields

[width="65%",cols="25%,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Field name | Description
| epochTs   | Recorded timestamp in Unix Timing
| userIDs   | User pairs [A, B] for each registered device interaction
|=======================================================================

`BluetoothPingsSummary` class is a summary of all user ids recorded

[width="65%",cols="25%,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Field name | Description
| userIDs   | User pairs [A, B] for each registered device interaction
| counts    | Total summed instances of all pairs [A, B] in the database
|=======================================================================

`Person` contains personal details of a user

[width="65%",cols="25%,",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Field name | Description
| userID    | Registered user id of the person
| name      | Person's name
| mobile    | Phone number
| nric      | NRIC identification beginning with S and ending with some alphabet
| age       | Person's age
|=======================================================================

== Design Considerations

=== Consideration: How can we extend our platform for customization of search features

* Alternative 1 (Current choice): Introduces concepts such as `conditions` and `aggregations` that are used by AppLogic
** Pros: Clean separation of logic
** Pros: Easily extensible to new conditions
** Cons: Added complexity may cause confusing to new users

* Alternative 2: Define fixed use cases and build code on those features
** Pros: Developers don't need to be confused with additional concepts
** Cons: Lack of flexibility and extensibility for new featuress

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the *System* is the `Contact tracing app` and the *Actor* is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

Launching the application is as simple as
```java
java -jar <application.jar>
```

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Run the command above

   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.
