== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteitem 1`.

.Component interactions for `deleteitem 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SideTabsBar`, `XYZTabPanel`, `DashboardPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `EasyTravelParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteitem 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteitem 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteItemCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
====
XYZManager refers to:

* `TripManager`
* `ActivityManager`
* `TransportationBookingManager`
* `AccommodationBookingManager`
* `PackingListManager`
* `FixedExpenseManager`

The ObservableList<XYZ> includes all managers except for the Trip Manager
====

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/team/easytravel/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the XYZManager data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `team.easytravel.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
// tag::TripManagement[]

=== Trip Management
*_E.T._* only allow the user to manage one trip at a time and is necessary to be used first before other commands are available. This is done using the `settrip` command which requires the user to specify the `title` of the trip, the `budget` of the trip and the `start date` and `end date` of the entire trip.
For example, `settrip title/cheese land budget/2000 startdate/20-09-20 enddate/28-09-20` means that the trip with the title `cheese land` will be set with a budget of `2000` dollars and a duration of 8 days between `20-09-20` to `28-09-20`.

** title = cheese land

** budget = 2000

** start date = 20-09-20

** end date = 28-09-20

==== Rationale
The Trip Manager feature is the main driving feature that allows the users to set their trip schedule, budget as well
as the duration of the trip.
The Trip manager oversees the feature schedule and is essential to be set first before the user is allow to access any other features within the application. This is for the application to ensure that user must have a trip in mind before being allowed to plan for the trip.

==== Current Implementation
The keywords from the command given by user is parsed using `SetTripCommandParser` which converts the string
variable of the `startDate` and `endDate` into a java `Date` object, the `title` into a `Title` object while the `budget` is converted into `Budget` objects.
These objects are used to create the `SetTripCommand` object that can be execution to create the trip. Execution of this object would hence enable other features within the application.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `SetTripCommand` object:

.Sequence diagram that describes the creation of the `SetTripCommand` from the input user command `settrip title/cheese budget/2000 startdate/20-09-20 enddate/28-09-20`.
image::developer-guide/trip/SetTripCommandCreation.png[]

After the creation of the `SetTripCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `SetTripCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `SetTripCommand`:

1. The `Schedule` object, `Budget` object, `startDate` and `endDate` is passed into the `createTrip()` method of `Model` and parse into a `Trip` object.
2. A new `Scheduler` will be created while `Budget` object, `startDate` and `endDate` object given by the `Trip object`  .
3. The `trip` object will calculate and initialise the `duration` of the trip using the given `startDate` and `endDate`.
4. `Trip` would enable access to other commands within application.

The sequence diagram below shows the the execution of `SetTripCommand`:

.Sequence diagram that describes the execution of ScheduleActivityCommand.
image::developer-guide/trip/f.png[SetTrip Command Execution PlaceHolder]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Trip is isolated from any list manager

* **Current Choice:** Trip is isolated from all list managing
** Pros: Better user experience. Single Responsibility: only handles objects necessary for a `trip` to exist
and be added into the schedule.
** Cons: Complicated to implement and more likely to result in bugs.

===== Aspect: Creation of trip is required before use of any other commands

* **Current Choice:** A trip must be created before use of any other commands
** Pros: Ensures that users cannot implement any activity or schedule without creation of an activity.
** Cons: Complicate to implement and likely result in dependency issues

* **Alternative:** A trip can be created after the use of any other commands
** Pros: Gives the user the freedom to use commands before the trip is set, such as the budgeting and packing list.
** Cons: Defeats the purpose of planning the trip from top down, starting from the trip being set first.
// end::Trip Management[]


// end::Check Status[]
=== Check Status
==== Rationale

Currently, E.T allows a user to keep track of multiple aspects of a trip.
However, they exist as separate lists and there is little to no integration between them.

For example, the fixed expense list has little to no correlation with the packing list, but they are both
important aspects of a trip. As such, the motivation behind creating a “check status” is to create that missing link between the different lists and make E.T more integrated and easier to use for the user.

This feature allows the user to compress all the information from the lists into a single pane and
alerts the user if they have forgotten to plan for a certain aspect of a trip.
Before this, the user would have to scroll through each list, look at what they might have forgotten to plan or do.

Therefore, this would help reduce the amount of information the user would need to process, and indirectly the stresses which accompany the planning for a trip.

==== Overview
E.T’s database stores a hard-coded checklist. For example, it would check if the user has planned for an
accommodation booking for every single day of the trip and would be informed through the
`checkstatus` command if they have forgotten to plan for it.

*TIP*
However, users can also include their own preset `checkstatus` to suit their needs {v2.0}

==== Current Implementation
The `checkstatus` command checks what the user have planned against the checklist from our database.
The `checkstatus` command is created by parsing the user’s inputs to form a `checkStatusCommand` where E.T’s
database is filtered to return the user with the checklist.

The following activity diagram shown in <<Figure x.x>> below, summarizes what happens when a user enters a `checkstatus`
command:


.Sequence diagram showing the workflow of a `checkstatus` command.
image::developer-guide/check-status-feature/CheckStatusCommandExecution.png[]

In detail, whenever a “checkstatus” command is entered,
the command will be identified by E.T by parsing it through the `EasyTravelParser` through the `Logic` component.
A `CheckStatusCommand` will be created.
E.T will then check against the hard-coded database and generate a checklist of what the
user might have forgotten to prepare for their upcoming trip.
The following sequence diagram shown in <<Figure x.x>> below,
summarizes the sequence flow when a user enters a valid `checkstatus` command:

From the sequence diagram:

****
1.	When the `LogicManager` receives the “execute” command from `MainApp`, it will call the `parseCommand` method of
`EasyTravelParser`.
2.	`EasyTravelParser` will receive `checkstatus` as the command type and instantiate `CheckStatusCommand`
3.	Through `Model”, the `CheckStatusCommand` will check the individual lists
against the hard-coded database in `Storage` to ensure that the user had made sufficient planning for the trip.
4. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` back to `LogicManager` if the user had made
sufficient planning for the upcoming trip.
5.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `CheckStatusCommand`, `LogicManager` will then proceed to
return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the checklist will be shown to the user.
****

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Access to all list

* **Current Choice:** Check status has access to all lists

** **Pros:** Easy to implement and understand. Check status can call and access all variables from the lists.

** **Cons:** There might be dependency issues.

* **Alternative:** User will have to check each list one by one

** **Pros:** No dependency issues, as all lists are kept separated.

** **Cons:** Troublesome for the user to check each list one by one.

// tag::scheduleactivity[]
=== Schedule feature
*_E.T._* allows the user to schedule an activity from the activity list to a specified time of a day.
This is done using the `schedule` command which requires the user to specify the `activity index` of an activity from
the displayed activity list, the `day number` of the trip and the `start time` of the activity to be scheduled. For
example, `schedule 1 day/2 starttime/13:00` means that the activity with the index of `1` will be schedule on the second
day of the trip at 1pm. Before using the `schedule` command, the user should have filled up the activity list with
activities.

==== Rationale
The schedule feature is an important feature that allows the users to manage and plan for their trip schedule or itinerary.
This feature is separated from the activity management feature to increase the ease of planning because users can just focus
on the time management aspect when scheduling proposed activities from the activity list.

==== Current Implementation
The keywords from the command given by user is parsed using `ScheduleActivityCommandParser` which converts the string
variable of the `start time` into a java `Time` object, while `activity index` and `day number` are converted into `Index` objects.
These objects are used to create the `ScheduleActivityCommand` object that can be execution to schedule the activity.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `ScheduleActivityCommand` object:

.Sequence diagram that describes the creation of the `ScheduleActivityCommand` from the input user command `schedule 1 day/2 starttime/13:00`.
image::developer-guide/schedule-feature/ScheduleActivityCommandCreation.png[]

After the creation of the `ScheduleActivityCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `ScheduleActivityCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

1. `Model` retrieves the list of activities from the `UniqueList` that stores `Activity` objects.
2. The `activityIndex` is used to obtain the target `Activity` from the activity list.
3. The `Activity` object, `dayIndex` and `startTime` is passed into the `scheduleActivity()` method of `Model`.
4. `Activity` is converted to a `Schedulee` object using the `startTime` from the `ScheduleActivityCommand`, the `title` and `duration` from the target `Activity`.
5. The `Schedulee` object is added to the target day's `DaySchedule`.
6. The list of `Schedulee` is sorted according to the `startTime`.

The sequence diagram below shows the the execution of `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

.Sequence diagram that describes the execution of ScheduleActivityCommand.
image::developer-guide/schedule-feature/ScheduleActivityCommandExecution.png[Schedule Activity Command Execution]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Separation between scheduling and activity management

* **Current Choice:** Scheduling is separated from activity management.
** Pros: Better user experience. Allows for extension: other type of objects could easily be converted into a `Schedulee` object
and be added into the schedule.
** Cons: Complicated to implement and more likely to result in bugs.
* **Alternative:** Activity must be scheduled directly into a day.
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Increase difficulty planning for users and limit the schedule to `Activity` objects only.


// tag::transportbooking[]
=== Transport Booking feature

E.T. allows the user to add a transport booking. This is done using the schedule command which requires the user to specify the mode, start location, end location, start time and end time.

==== Rationale

The transport booking feature is an important feature that allows the user to track the list of transport bookings that they have made before leaving.
This feature also allows the user to schedule their activities while taking the scheduled transport bookings into consideration.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AddTransportBookingCommandParser` which converts the string variable `mode` into a `Mode` object, `start location` and `end location` into a `Location` objects, as well as `start time` and `end time` into `Time` objects.
These objects are used to create the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object that will execute to create a transport booking.

The activity diagram below shows the creation of the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object:

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of a `AddTransportBooking` command.
image::developer-guide/transport-booking/AddTransportBookingActivityDiagram.png[]

After the creation of the `AddTransportBookingCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `AddTransportBookingCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `AddTransportBookingCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `AddTransportBookingCommand` checks the current transport booking list for duplicates before adding the new object into the transport booking list
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful addition of the transport booking into the transport booking list
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `AddTransportBookingCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the updated transport booking list is shown.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect:

* **Current Choice:**
** **Pros:**
** **Cons:**

* **Alternative:**
** **Pros:**
** **Cons:**
// end::transportbooking[]

// tag::accommodationbooking[]
=== Accommodation Booking feature

E.T. allows the user to add an accommodation booking. This is done using the schedule command which requires the user to specify the accommodation name, location, start day, end day and a remark. This feature also prevents the user from having an overlap of accommodation.

The activity contains the following fields:

* `accommodation name`
* `location`
* `start day`
* `end day`
* `remarks`

==== Rationale

The accommodation booking feature is an important feature that allows the user to track the list of accommodation bookings that they have made before leaving.

==== Current Implementation

When a user adds an accommodation booking using the `AddAccommodationBookingCommandParser`, an `AddAccommodationBookingCommand` object is created that will execute to create an accommodation booking. When the `execute()` method is called, a method `isOverlappingWithOthers()` will check if there is an overlap of the new accommodation booking with the other bookings.

Using a stream, the new accommodation booking will be against all other bookings in the list to find look for any overlaps. The activity diagram shows how 2 bookings are checked if there is an overlap:

.Activity diagram of check overlap for 2 accommodation bookings
image::developer-guide/accommodation-booking/FindOverlapActivityDiagram.png[]

The following steps describes the process of the check overlap method:

. The start day and end day of both bookings are retrieved using `getStartDay()` and `getEndDay()`
. The largest end day and smallest start day is calculated and the difference of the largest and smallest is calculated
. The duration of both bookings is calculated by adding the difference of the end day and start day of both bookings
. If the difference of the largest end day and smallest start day is greater than the duration of both bookings, there is no overlap. The accommodation booking will then be added into the list.
. If there is an overlap, user will receive a message that informs that there is the new accommodation booking has an overlap with another booking.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Calculating overlap of the new accommodation booking with the other accommodation bookings in the list

|===
| |Pros |Cons
|Current Choice : Using stream to compare the accommodation bookings
|Few lines of codes needed to compare the bookings, follows the KISS principle
|Difficult for beginner users to understand our code

|Alternative Choice: Using an arraylist of days to track accommodations
|Easy to use and understand
|Requires many lines of code, may become difficult to read
|===
// end::accommodationbooking[]

// tag::activity[]
=== Activity Manager
*_E.T._* allows the user to plan for their `activity` for a trip. The activity manager handles everything to do with manipulating of activities.

This `addactivity` command requires the user to include the `title` of an activity, the `priority` of the activity , the `duration` of the activity in terms of hours, `Location` of the activity and optional `tags`.

List of commands that helps with activity management:

* `addactivity title/TITLE priority/PRIORITY duration/DURATION location/LOCATION t/TAG` --  create an activity with the given title, priority, duration, location and tags. There can be more than one tags included
* `clearactivity`  -- Clears the entire activity list
* `deleteactivity index`  -- Deletes the activity based on index
* `editactivity index [title/TITLE] [priority/PRIORITY] [duration/DURATION] [location/LOCATION] [t/TAG]` -- Edits the activity based on index

Example:

`addactivity title/Big Cheese Land priority/1 duration/2 location/The moon t/nice` will create an activity named `Big Cheese` with a priority of `1` , duration of `2` and is happening at a location `The moon`. The activity would also have the tag `nice`


The user can use any other activity command if there exist at least one activity in the list.

==== Rationale
The activity manager allows user to plan and manage their activities for the trip.
The activity manager only handles activities and the manipulation of activities.

==== Current Implementation
The keywords from the command given by user is parsed using a parser for the respective command

e.g `DeleteActivityCommandParser`

These objects are used to create the command object for their respective command that can be execution to schedule the activity.

e.g `DeleteActivity`

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of a `deleteactivity` command.
image::developer-guide/activity/DeleteActivityActivityDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the an ActivityCommand object:

.Sequence diagram that describes the creation of the `deleteactivity` from the input user command `deleteactivity 1`.

image::developer-guide/activity/DeleteActivityCommandCreation.png[]

After the creation of the `DeleteActivityCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `DeleteActivityCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `ScheduleActivityCommand`:

1. `Model` retrieves the list of activities from the `UniqueList` that stores `Activity` objects.
2. The `activityIndex` is used to find the target `Activity` from the activity list.
3. The `Activity` object that corresponds to the index is removed from the list


The sequence diagram below shows the the execution of `DeleteActivityCommand`:

.Sequence diagram that describes the execution of ScheduleActivityCommand.
image::developer-guide/activity/DeleteActivityCommandExecution.png[Delete Activity Command Execution placeholder]

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect: Activity does not keep track of the day

* **Current Choice:** Days is being tracked by scheduler
** **Pros:** Separation of concerns: Only the scheduler should know which day the activity is held on.
** **Cons:** {kiv}
// end::activity[]

// tag::packinglist[]
=== Packing List feature

*_E.T._* allows the user to create a packing list. The packing list manager handles everything to do with manipulating of packing list items.

The packing list item contains the following fields:

* `itemName`
* `quantity`
* `itemCategory`

`PackingListManager` has commands other than the basic CRUD commands, such as:

* `finditem`
** Finds packing list items based on the keywords given by the user
* `finditemcategory`
** Finds packing list items in the categories given by the user
* `addpreset`
** Adds a pre-existing list of items in a category into the current packing list
* `listpreset`
** Shows the available presets that the user can add into the packing list

I will be focusing on the `addpreset` command here. The `addpreset` command requires the user to include the `category` of the preset they want to add into the packing list.
For example, `addpreset swimming` means that the preset called `swimming` will be added into the user's packing list.
Only pre-existing presets can be added into the user's packing list.

==== Rationale
The packing list feature is an important feature that allows the users to plan and pack for their trip. It ensures that the user did not forget to pack anything for their trip, providing convenience.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `AddPresetCommandParser` which converts the string variable `category` into a `ItemCategory` object.
These objects are used to create the `AddPresetCommand` object that will execute to create a list of packing list items.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `AddPresetCommand` object:

.Activity diagram showing the workflow of an `addpreset` command.
image::developer-guide/packing-list/AddPackingListActivityDiagram.png[]

After the creation of the `AddPresetCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `AddPresetCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `AddPresetCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `AddPresetCommand` adds a list of pre-existing list of items under a category into the packing list. If it encounters duplicates, it will skip the duplicate, and continue adding the rest of the items in the preset into the packing list.
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful addition of the preset items into the packing list.
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `AddPresetCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the updated packing list is shown.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect:

* **Current Choice:** Users choose a preset list of items under a category
** **Pros:** Gives the user more convenience; allows them to add a list of items at one go, instead of adding an item each time.
** **Cons:** Users are only able to choose from the pre-existing list of presets, hence not a lot of freedom to create their own preset.

* **Alternative:** Users create their own presets
** **Pros:** Gives the user a lot of freedom to customise their presets and packing list, making it user focused.
** **Cons:** Difficult to implement
// end::packinglist[]

// tag::fixedexpense[]
=== Fixed expense feature

*_E.T._* allows the user to create a fixed expense. The fixed expense manager handles everything to do with manipulating of fixed expenses.

This `sortexpense` command requires the user to include the `order` of the sorting, which is either ascending or descending, and the `criteria` of the sorting, which is either amount, blah or category.
For example, `sortexpense asc amount` sorts the fixed expense list in ascending order, according to the amount of the fixed expenses.

==== Rationale
The fixed expense feature is an important feature that allows the users to plan financially for their trip. It allows the user keeps track of the amount spent on the big ticket items, such as plane tickets and accommodation bookings.

==== Current Implementation

The keywords from the command given by the user is parsed using `SortFixedExpenseCommandParser` which converts the retrieves the order of the sort, and the sorting criteria.
These objects are used to create the `SortFixedExpenseCommand` object that will execute the sorting of the fixed expense list according to the given order and criteria.

The sequence diagram below shows the creation of the `SortFixedExpenseCommand` object:

[KIV]
Figure x.x: Sequence diagram of a Sort Fixed Expense command.

After the creation of the `SortFixedExpenseCommand` object, the `LogicManager` will proceed to call the `execute()` method of `SortFixedExpenseCommand`.

The following steps describes the execution of the `SortFixedExpenseCommand`:

1.	In `Model`, the `SortFixedExpenseCommand` sorts the current fixed expense list according to an order and criteria.
2. A `CommandResult` object which consists of a `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` is sent back to `LogicManager` if there is a successful sorting of the fixed expense list.
3.	After receiving the `CommandResult` from `SortFixedExpenseCommand`, `LogicManager` will return the `CommandResult` back to “MainApp” where the sorted fixed expense list is shown.

==== Design Consideration

===== Aspect:

* **Current Choice:** Sorting criteria can only be `amount`, `description` or `category`
** **Pros:** Keeps the implementation simple, as well as the fields of fixed expense only contain the above criteria
** **Cons:** Restricts the user on the criteria they can use, prevents them from customising the sorting of their fixed expense list.

* **Alternative:** Sorting criteria can be anything the user inputs
** **Pros:** Not restricted to a fixed criteria, gives the user freedom to choose and customise their sorting criteria.
** **Cons:** Difficult to implement, too many criteria to consider.
// end::fixedexpense[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
