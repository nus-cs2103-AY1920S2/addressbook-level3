=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::developer-guide/common/ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `exercise delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `exercise delete 1` command
image::developer-guide/common/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Main]]
=== Main Component
.Structure of the Main Component
image::developer-guide/common/MainClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/Main.java[`Main.java`]

The `Main` class consists of the `SplashScreen` and the `MainApp`.

When the app starts up, `Main#main` is called. This sets the `Preloader` of the `Application` to be `SplashScreen`. Thereafter, it launches `MainApp`.

During the GUI start up process, the `SplashScreen` will first load on a `Thread`. In the meantime, `MainApp#init` will run. Once `MainApp#init` completes, and just as `MainApp#start` is about to run, `MainApp` will send a `Preloader.StateChangeNotification` to `SplashScreen` to close its window. After that, `UiManager#start` is called, which creates the view for the main application.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::developer-guide/common/UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of a `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and other panels. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{codeURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component executes user commands using the `Logic` component.

For more information about each component, check out the 'Implementation' section.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::developer-guide/common/LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `ParserManager` class to parse the user command
. The `ParserManager` creates and returns a `Command` object
. The `Command` object is executed by the `LogicManager`
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a exercise).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying the list of workouts.

Inside the `Logic` package, there are some utility classes such as the `ArgumentTokenizer`. It is responsible for tokenizing an input and returning an `ArgumentMultimap`, which can be used to get the value of a particular `Prefix`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::developer-guide/common/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ExerciseCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

For more information about each component, check out the 'Implementation' section.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::developer-guide/common/ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores an `ExerciseList` that represents the list of exercises.
* stores a `WorkoutList` that represents the list of workouts available.
* stores a `ScheduleList` that represents the list of upcoming schedules.
* stores a `LogList` that represents the list of completed data.
* stores a `TimerList` that represents a time delta in seconds.
* stores an `Optional` `OngoingWorkout` that may contain a session, if started.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Exercise>`, `ObservableList<Workout>`, `ObservableList<ScheduledWorkout>`, `ObservableList<Log>`, `ObservableList<OngoingSet>`, and `ObservableList<Integer>` (time delta) that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other components.

For more information about each component, check out the 'Implementation' section.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::developer-guide/common/StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{codeURL}/src/main/java/seedu/zerotoone/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component is resonsible for the persistent storage of the application. It can save these class in JSON format and read it back:

* `UserPrefs`
* `Exercise`
* `Workout`
* `Schedule`
* `Log`

For more information about each component, check out the 'Implementation' section.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.zerotoone.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how each features are implemented.

// tag::session[]

=== Session (Home)
==== Implementation
The Session feature resides on the Home page and is comprised of `Start`, `Stop`, `Done`, and `Skip` commands.
`OngoingWorkout`, `OngoingSession`, `OngoingSet`, and `OngoingSetList` are models that are vital components of the feature.

The Session feature also seamlessly incorporates a functional timer. Timer functionality is found embedded in the session related functions in `ModelManager`.

The activity diagram below demonstrates the actions of a user with this feature.

.Session Feature Activity Diagram
image::developer-guide/session/StartStopActivityDiagram.png[]

Start depicts the start of a valid (non-zero sets remaining) Workout Session.
Upon depletion of all remaining sets, the `OngoingWorkout` automatically stops and produces a `CompletedWorkout` which is saved.
The only inputs the user is required to give throughout the session are `done` (corresponding to the yes of the conditional branch)
and `skip` (no of the conditional branch). `Stop` is optional.

This is a conscious design choice as elaborated in the next section.

---

The operations handling these actions are found in `OngoingWorkout`:

* `OngoingWorkout#skip()/OngoingWorkout#done()` -- removes and returns the next set and updates queue of remaining sets.
* `OngoingWorkout#finish()` -- creates and returns an immutable `CompletedWorkout` object for saving and logging.

Further operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#startSession()` and `Model#stopSession()`.

.Session related models
image::developer-guide/session/SessionModel.png[]

The above class diagram briefly depicts how the session related models (in `OngoingWorkout`) interact with surrounding classes.

The `OngoingWorkout` class has a dependency on `Workout`, which has been abstracted for clarity.

In turn, `CompletedWorkout` class has a dependency on `OngoingWorkout`.

`OngoingWorkout` objects are created at the start of a workout session, and can be thought of as 'converted' to `CompletedWorkout` objects at the end of a workout session. `Workout` and `CompletedWorkout` objects are immutable, hence the design choice for using an intermediary, stateuful, `OngoingWorkout` class.

---

The inner workings of the feature are briefly expounded below through a simple simulation.
`Arms Day` is a `Workout` with ID = `2` and consists of 2 sets of one exercise called `Bench Press`.


.Example Workout Session
image::developer-guide/session/sessionExample.png[]

Step 1. The user selects an existing `Workout` called `Arms Day` with ID = `2` and starts a session with `start 2`.

* `Logic` and `Parser` redirect control to `StartCommand#execute()` where an instance of `OngoingWorkout` is created with
the `Arms Day` object. The upcoming set of the next exercise is displayed for the user.

* The timer starts counting. This acts as a visual cue for the user that notifies the start of the workout and is essentially a once-off, superfluous action, since it's main purpose is to time rest between sets.

Step 2. The user completes the first set and types `done`.

* `DoneCommand#execute()` is invoked, which in turn calls `Model#done()` to obtain the last `CompletedSet` object to display on the UI, and statefully
updates the instance of `OngoingWorkout`.

* The rest timer resets to 00:00 and starts counting.

.DoneCommand sequence diagram
image::developer-guide/session/DoneCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

* The sequence diagram above demonstrates the interaction between the Logic and Model of ZeroToOne.
For brevity, some inner details between `OngoingWorkout.done()` and the return of `cs` are omitted.

Step 3. After resting, the user fails the last and final set of `Bench Press` and types `skip`.

* `SkipCommand#execute()` is invoked. The process is almost identical to the above execution of `done` except this time the instance of `CompletedSet` is created with `isFinished` set to `false`.

* Since this is the final set of the session, `OngoingWorkout#hasSetLeft()`
returns false, and `OngoingWorkout#finish()` is called which creates and returns an immutable `CompletedWorkout` object. This object
is saved and passed on for use by the `Log` feature.

* The workout session is now complete, and the timer and UI is reset.

* The workout session can be viewed in the `Log` tab.

[Note] In the usual flow, the `stop` command is not used, and is reserved only for a premature ending of a
workout session, where all remaining sets are marked as incomplete.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Seamless user-first experience
* **Current Implementation:** Minimal commands and typing during an ongoing session. Timer functionality is completely automatic.
** Pros: Less interruption during actual exercising to enter commands.
** Cons: More experienced users are not able to have a more customizable workout.


===== Aspect: Beginner-friendly set order
* **Current Implementation:** Exercises and sets have fixed ordering based on their creation.
** Pros: Easier for new user to follow a workout session, less typing required during a workout session. Session has simple and predictable behaviour.
** Cons: Experienced users are not able to have an ad-hoc, customizable workout without creating a new workout with the specific order they want.

// end::session[]

// tag::exercise[]
=== Exercise
==== Overview
The Exercise feature forms the basic building block for the application. It allows users to CRUD exercises, which will then be used for the creation of workouts. The command is prefixed by the keyword `exercise`. Available commands are `create`, `edit`, `list`, `delete` and many more.

==== Implementation
The following portion will explain in-detail each component of the Exercise feature.

===== Model
.Exercise Model Structure
image::developer-guide/exercise/ExerciseModelClassDiagram.png[]

The figure above depicts the Model of the Exercise feature. Starting from the most primitive type:

. `NumReps` stores the number of repetitions a person has to complete for a particular exercise set
. `Weight` stores the weight in kg that a person has to complete for a particular exercise set
. `ExerciseSet` represents an exercise set that a person has to complete. Each `ExerciseSet` comprises of exactly 1 `NumReps` object and 1 `Weight` object
. `ExerciseName` stores the name of a particular exercise
. `Exercise` represents a collection of exercise sets that a person has to complete. Each `Exercise` will consists of exactly 1 `ExerciseName` object and any number of `ExerciseSet` (including zero)
. `UniqueExerciseList` represents a collection of `Exercise` objects. There can be any number of `Exercise` objects in `UniqueExerciseList`, but they must be unique.
. `ExerciseList` implements the interface `ReadOnlyExerciseList` that ensures that the outward-facing exercise list is unmodifiable by other modules. The `ExerciseList` object has exactly 1 `UniqueExerciseList` for storage purposes.
. `ExerciseList` is controlled by the `ModelManager`.

Do note that some of the `Exercise` objects in the `ExerciseList` are also referenced in the `WorkoutList`. For more information, refer to the `Workout` implementation.

===== Storage
.Exercise Storage Structure
image::developer-guide/exercise/ExerciseStorageClassDiagram.png[]

The Storage component provides the functionalities that enable the persistent storage of the model. Starting from the most primitive type:

. `JacksonExerciseSet` contains exactly two `String` objects, one for the number of repetitions and one for the weight. This class has a dependency to the `NumReps` and `Weight` model due to the `toModelType()` function. This function converts `JacksonExerciseSet` into the model's `ExerciseSet` so that it can be used in other parts of the application.
. `JacksonExercise` contains exactly one `String` object that represents the exercise name, and any number of `JacksonExerciseSet` objects. Similarly, it has a dependency to `ExerciseName`, `ExerciseSet` and `Exercise` object due to the `toModelType()` function.
. `JacksonExerciseList` is the persistent storage for the `ExerciseList` model, and it contains any number of `JacksonExercise` objects.
. `ExerciseListStorageManager` implements the `ExerciseListStorage` which provides certain functionalities required for the storage to work properly. The `ExerciseListStorageManager` is controlled by the `StorageManager`.

===== Logic - Commands
.Exercise Commands Structure
image::developer-guide/exercise/ExerciseCommandClassDiagram.png[]

The Exercise Commands package stores the business logic of the exercise feature. The commands are organised in a hierarchical fashion, in the order of precedence in a valid input. For example, `SetCommand` inherits from `ExerciseCommand` as the `set` comes after `exercise` in the input `exercise set`.

Each command contains a `COMMAND_WORD` which is a single word that is unique to the command. Each command also implements an `execute` method that represents the logic of the command. Instructions to control the model, storage and view are stored inside this method.

===== Logic - Parsers
.Exercise Parser Structure
image::developer-guide/exercise/ExerciseParserClassDiagram.png[]

The parsers are responsible for parsing a user input into a `Command` object. For the Exercise component, there are parsers for every command that accepts user arguments. For example, since `exercise list` does not take in any argument, there is no parser for the `ListCommand`. After parsing the user input, the parser will return `Command` object to the caller, which will execute the command via the `execute` method.

===== Sample Command Execution
This section will illustrate an example of an exercise command execution using the input `exercise create e/Bench Press`.

.Exercise's CreateCommand Sequence Diagram
image::developer-guide/exercise/CreateCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

In this portion, we will trace the sequence diagram of the `exercise create` command to better understand the internals of the Exercise feature.

. The user enters the command `exercise create e/Bench Press`
. `LogicManager` will pass the command to the `ParserManager` for parsing
. `ParserManager` upon seeing that the command is prefixed by `exercise` creates a `ExerciseCommandParser`
. `ParserManager` then pass `create e/Bench Press` to `ExerciseCommandParser`
. `ExerciseCommandParser` upon seeing that the command is prefixed by `create` creates a `CreateCommandParser`
. `ExerciseCommandParser` then pass the argument `e/Bench Press` to `CreateCommandParser`
. `CreateCommandParser` then attempts to create an `ExerciseName` object using the `String` in the argument
. Using the `ExerciseName`, `CreateCommandParser` then create a `CreateCommand` object with the exercise name
. The `CreateCommand` is then passed back to the `LogicManager`
. `LogicManager` calls `c.execute()`
. `CreateCommand` will attempt to create an `Exercise` using the exercise name
. After creating the `Exercise` object, the `CreateCommand` will attempt to store the new exercise by calling the `addExercise` method of `Model`
. After the exercise is successfully added, a `CommandResult` object is created
. This result is then passed back to the `LogicManager` which will display the output on the GUI

===== Summary
.Editing Exercise Set Activity Diagram
image::developer-guide/exercise/EditSetActivityDiagram.png[]

At this point, you should have gather enough information to start developing the Exercise feature. As a summary, this is a sample Activity Diagram that depicts a user flow when they want to edit an exercise set.

==== Design Considerations
===== Parser Component
One of the consideration while designing was that the commands in exercise are extremely nested. We have commands such as `exercise set create r/1 m/10`. While we could have chucked all the parsing in `ExerciseSetCreateParser` class, we realised that it will be better if we were to abstract the parser into separate classes. This allows us to group the functionalities of the parser in a single file. For example, `ExerciseCommandParser` will parse any string that has the word `exercise` as the prefix. `SetCommandParser` will do so for a prefix of `set`. This means that for the above command, while we have to go through multiple parsers which can make the performance of the application suffer, each of the parsers have a single responsibility which makes it a better design choice.

===== Model Component
For the Model component, note that `Exercise` objects are supposed to be unique whereas `ExerciseSet` objects are not. This is created due to our observations of the workout regimes in the real world.

For `ExerciseSet`, while set weights and number of repetitions tend to vary during an exercise, users may want to have the freedom to do multiple sets with the same configuration during the course of the exercise. Hence, it is unwise to make it unique.

However, for exercises, we noted that users tend to reuse the same exercise throughout different workout plans. At the same time, there is a high chance of users creating duplicate exercises when the number of exercises in the application increases significantly. Therefore, we chose to make `Exercise` a unique object instead.

// end::exercise[]

// tag::workout[]
=== Workout
==== Overview
The workout feature in ZeroToOne allows users to manage their workouts! Users will be able to create a workout, add exercises to it, as well as edit the workout and its exercises, and more.

.Activity Diagram for Creating a Workout
image::developer-guide/workout/WorkoutActivityDiagram.png[]

This is an activity diagram for the user to create a new workout. Essentially, the user will first create a workout with a name that does not contain any exercises yet. The user will then try to find exercises to add, and if their desired exercises cannot be found, the user will create them and add them into the workout.

==== Components
The Workout Manager consists of a `WorkoutList`, which contains a number of workouts that the user has created.
Each workout consists of a `WorkoutId`, a `WorkoutName` and finally, an `WorkoutExerciseList`.

The following class diagram shows the overview of the Workout feature:

.Class Diagram for Workout
image::developer-guide/workout/WorkoutClassDiagram.png[]

* `WorkoutList` implements the interface `ReadOnlyWorkoutList`
* The `WorkoutList` is managed by the `ModelManager`
* `FilteredWorkoutList` is an aggregation of one `WorkoutList`, to filter the view of the workout list shown to the user
* `WorkoutList` composes of a `UniqueWorkoutList`
* In turn, a `UniqueWorkoutList` contains any number of `Workout` objects
* Each `Workout` is comprised of two things: a `WorkoutName` and any number of `Exercise` objects
** `WorkoutName` contains the name of the `Workout`
** `Exercise` is an exercise that belongs in a `Workout`

NOTE: Each `Workout` can contain any number of `Exercise` objects, including zero. However, a `Workout` must not be empty i.e. have at least one `Exercise`, in order to be scheduled. This is implemented in the Schedule feature as referenced in <<Schedule>>.

==== Workout Model
ZeroToOne's `Model` extends the `WorkoutModel`. Here are all the functions to carry out workout-related activities:

* `Model#getWorkoutListFilePath()` - Retrieves the `Path` of the `WorkoutList`
* `Model#setWorkoutListFilePath(Path workoutListFilePath)` - Sets the `Path` of the `WorkoutList`
* `Model#setWorkoutList(ReadOnlyWorkoutList workoutList)` - Sets the `WorkoutList` to be a `ReadOnlyWorkoutList`
* `Model#getWorkoutList()` - Returns an unmodifiable `ReadOnlyWorkoutList`
* `Model#hasWorkout(Workout workout)` - Returns true if a workout exists in the workout list
* `Model#deleteWorkout(Workout target)` - Deletes a specified workout from the workout list
* `Model#addWorkout(Workout target)` - Adds a new workout to the workout list
* `Model#setWorkout(Workout target, Workout editedWorkout)` - Replaces a particular workout with an edited workout
* `Model#setExerciseInWorkout(Exercise target, Exercise editedExericse` - Replaces a target exercise in any workout with the edited exercise
* `Model#deleteExerciseFromWorkout(Exercise exercise)` - Deletes any instance of an exercise from all workouts
* `Model#getFilteredWorkoutList()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of `ObservableList<Workout>`
* `Model#updateFilteredWorkoutList(Predicate<Workout> predicate)` - Updates the filter of `FilteredWorkoutList` to show filtered views of the list to the user

==== Storage of Workouts
.Class Diagram for Workout Storage
image::developer-guide/workout/WorkoutStorageClassDiagram.png[]

1. The `WorkoutListStorageManager` implements the interface `WorkoutListStorage`. It also creates a `JacksonWorkoutList`.
2. The `JacksonWorkoutList` composes of any number of `JacksonWorkout` objects.
3. In turn, each `JacksonWorkout` composes of a `String` which is the workout name, and any number of `JacksonExercise` objects which are the exercises in each workout.
4. The relationship of the Storage component to the Model component is also shown.

==== Parser for Workouts
I will go on to explain the Parser structure for the workout commands.

.Class Diagram of the Parser for Workouts
image::developer-guide/workout/WorkoutParserClassDiagram.png[]

* The `WorkoutCommandParser` creates all `Workout` related Parsers. These parsers allow the user to create, edit, delete and find workouts, as can be seen in the left hand side of the above diagram.
* In addition, the `WorkoutCommandParser` creates the `WorkoutExerciseCommandParser`.
* In turn, `WorkoutExerciseCommandParser` creates all workout `Exercise` related Parsers. These parsers allow the user to add, edit and delete said `Exercise` objects.

==== Sample Command Execution

To illustrate an example of a command from the Workout Manager, the following sequence diagram
depicts flow of the program when the command `workout find w/Arms Workout` is run.

.Sequence Diagram for Finding a Workout
image::developer-guide/workout/WorkoutSequenceDiagram.png[]

. When the user runs the command `workout find w/Arms Workout`, the `LogicManager` will first take in the command, by calling the `execute()` function on it.
. The `ParserManager` then has to `parse("workout find w/Arms Workout")`.
. Next, the `WorkoutCommandParser` has to `parse("find w/Arms Workout")` for the command.
. Once the command has been parsed as a `FindCommand`, it will be passed on to the `FindCommandParser`.
. The `FindCommandParser` can then create a `FindCommand`. This is constructed with the `WorkoutName` for "Arms Workout" (a low-level detail that has been abstracted from the diagram).
. The `FindCommand` can be returned to the `LogicManager`, where it will `execute()` the `FindCommand`.
. `Model#updateFilteredWorkoutList(Predicate<Workout> predicate)` is used to update the view of the workout list to show the requested Workout(s), using the `PredicateFilterWorkoutName` that is returned by the `FindCommand` (a low-level detail that has been abstracted from the diagram).
. Finally, the resulting output message will be returned as the `CommandResult`.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Exercises in workout

* Option 1: Use existing `Exercise` class in `Workout`
** Advantage: Building on an existing class is simpler and more intuitive.
** Disadvantage: Introduces a dependency on the `Exercise` class
* Option 2: Create a new `WorkoutExercise` class for the `Workout` class
** Advantage: Creates an extra layer of abstraction and removes the dependency on `Exercise`.
** Disadvantage: More code needed which may be redundant.

In the end, I decided to stick with Option 1. This is because creating a new `WorkoutExercise` class
is redundant and unnecessary, when there is no functional difference between an `Exercise` and a `WorkoutExercise`,
other than the context that they are referenced in. In addition, this would make the deletion of any instance of a particular `Exercise` from a Workout easier, when an `Exercise` is deleted from the `ExerciseList`. Hence, to simplify matters, using the existing `Exercise` class to construct workouts was better.
// end::workout[]

// tag::schedule[]
=== Schedule


==== Overview
The schedule feature in ZeroToOne allows users to plan their workouts! Users will be able to create a schedule on a specific date and time in the future, edit the date and time, as well as delete the schedule.


==== Components
The following class diagram shows the overview of the `Scheduler`:

.Scheduler Class Diagram
image::developer-guide/schedule/ModelScheduleClassDiagram.png[]

As seen in the diagram above, The `Scheduler` consists two lists, `ScheduleList` and `ScheduledWorkoutList`.

The `ScheduleList` contains a number of `Schedule` that the user has created, while the `ScheduledWorkoutList` is essentially a chronologically sorted list of `ScheduledWorkout` that allows JavaFX listeners to track changes when they occur.

NOTE: The decision to have both `ScheduleList` and `ScheduledWorkoutList` may seem bizarre at first glance, but it is implemented this way after careful consideration, to better support operations on 'RecurringSchedule'(Proposed). Refer to <<Model Design Considerations>> for more information.


==== Schedule Model
ZeroToOne’s `Model` extends the `SchedulerModel`. Here are all the functions to carry out schedule-related activities:

* `Model#hasSchedule(Schedule schedule)` - Returns true if a schedule exists in the schedule list

* `Model#addSchedule(Schedule schedule)` - Adds a new schedule to the schedule list

* `Model#setSchedule(Schedule scheduleToEdit, Schedule editedSchedule)` - Replaces a particular schedule with an edited schedule

* `Model#populateSortedScheduledWorkoutList()` - Clear and populate `SortedScheduledWorkoutList` by querying every `Schedule` in `SchedueList` through method `Schedule#getScheduledWorkout()`

* `Model#getSortedScheduledWorkoutList()` - Returns an unmodifiable view of `ObservableList<ScheduledWorkout>`

* `Model#deleteScheduledWorkout(ScheduledWorkout scheduledWorkoutToDelete)` - Deletes the `Schedule` that generated the specified `ScheduledWorkout` from the schedule list, then re-populates `SortedScheduledWorkoutList`

* `Model#deleteWorkoutNameFromSchedule(WorkoutName workoutNameToDelete)` - Deletes all instances of schedules that are associated with the specified workout name

* `Model#editWorkoutNameInSchedule(WorkoutName workoutNameToEdit, WorkoutName editedWorkoutName)` - Updates all instances of schedules that are associated with the specified workout name to the new workout name

* `Model#getScheduleList()` - Returns an unmodifiable `ReadOnlyScheduleList`


==== Command Execution

===== Creating a Schedule
To illustrate an example of a command from the `Scheduler`, the following sequence diagram depicts flow of the program when the command `schedule create 1 d/2020-04-01 14:00` is run.

.Sequence Diagram for Creating a Schedule
image::developer-guide/schedule/ScheduleCreateSequenceDiagram.png[]

. When the user runs the command `schedule create 1 d/2020-04-01 14:00`, the `LogicManager` will first take in the command, by calling the `execute()` function on it.
. The `ParserManager` then has to `parse("schedule create 1 d/2020-04-01 14:00")`.
. Next, the `ScheduleCommandParser` has to `parse("create 1 d/2020-04-01 14:00")` for the command.
. Once the command has been parsed as a `CreateCommand`, it will be passed on to the `CreateCommandParser`, which will then parse the index using `ParserUtil`, and parse the date and time using `ScheduleParserUtil`.
. The `CreateCommandParser` can then create a `CreateCommand`, which is then passed back to `LogicManager` to execute.
. When `LogicManager` executes the `CreateCommand`, it creates a new `Schedule`, and checks whether the model already contains this `Schedule`.
. If the model does not contain this `Schedule`, the `LogicalManager` will then add it to the model by calling `Model#addSchedule(schedule)`.
. Finally, the resulting output message will be returned as the `CommandResult`.

NOTE: Date and time must not be outdated and follow the format {yyyy}-{mm}-{dd} {HH:mm}

===== Populating the SortedScheduledWorkoutList

And the following sequence diagram shows how the `ScheduledWorkoutList` is populated after the method `Model#addSchedule(schedule)` is called:

.Sequence Diagram for Populating `SortedScheduledWorkoutList`
image::developer-guide/schedule/PopulateSortedScheduledWorkoutList.png[]

. After the `LogicManager` calls the method `Model#addSchedule(schedule)`, `ModelManager` calls `Scheduler#addSchedule(schedule)`, which in turns calls `ScheduleList#addSchedule(schedule)` and adds the `Schedule` in the `ScheduleList`.
. The `Scheduler` will then populate the `ScheduledWorkoutList` by calling the method `populateSortedScheduledWorkoutList()`.
. First, `Scheduler` gets the current date and time by calling `DateTime#now()`.
. Then, `Scheduler` iterates through every `Schedule` in `ScheduleList`, and requests to get `ScheduledWorkout` by calling `Schedule#getScheduledWorkout(now)` on each of them.
. Finally, `Scheduler` resets the `SortedScheduledWorkoutList` with the latest `ScheduledWorkout` by calling `ScheduledWorkoutList#setScheduledWorkouts(scheduledWorkouts)`, and user's view of `ScheduledWorkout` is refreshed.
. And in the end, the resulting output message will be passed back to `LogicManager` and display to user.

NOTE: `Scheduler#populateSortedScheduledWorkoutList()` is called whenever the schedules in `ScheduleList` have been changed.


==== Model Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to handle editing and deletion of recurring schedules

* **Option 1:** `Model` stores only `ScheduledWorkout` objects.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Harder to maintain when it comes to `edit` or `delete` of recurring scheduled workouts.
* **Option 2 (current choice):** Saves `Schedule` objects that can be used to produce `ScheduledWorkout` when requested.
** Pros: Changes can be made to recurring schedules instead, and in turn reflect in all related `ScheduledWorkout`.
** Cons: Makes model much more complicated.

In the end, I decided to go with option 2 as it is easier to maintain, more extensible and less computationally expensive.

When the system has a number of recurring schedules that do not have an end date, it introduces a few problems:

* How many scheduled workouts to create/store for each recurring schedule
* How to efficiently retrieve and update all related scheduled workouts when a recurring schedule is edited or deleted

Implementing option 1 would mean that we will have to impose an additional constraint onto the system, which is either how many scheduled workouts to display for each recurring schedule or what is the longest time frame of scheduled workouts to display to user, as we simply can't generate indefinite number of scheduled workouts for technically everlasting recurring schedules. Additionally, when the number of high frequency recurring schedules in the system increases, it will be extremly computationally expensive to edit or delete recurring schedules, as the system will have to iterate through every ScheduledWorkout objects and update accordingly.

On the other hand, implementing option 2 makes it easier to handle these problems by storing changes to the Schedule objects instead, which can be used to generate ScheduleWorkout objects when requested. Moreover, it is more extensible because if we are going to introduce a calendar view in the future, where user can view a specific time frame of scheduled workouts, the system only needs to generate for that time frame only, which can be done much more efficiently!

=== Log Statistics
The log statistics feature in ZeroToOne allows users to view their completed workouts visually with meaningful aggregated information so they can see how much progress made.

==== Overview
The ZeroToOne user can generate and view these statistics via the `log display` command which takes in two optional parameters `startRange` and `endRange`. Workouts will only be considered if they fall within the `startTime` and `endTime` range.

===== Architecture
The log statistics feature was built from the ground up with modularity and extensibility in mind which is inline with SLAP and SOLID principles. This is exemplified in the decision to have a `DataPoint` abstract class. The class diagram is shown below.

.DataPoint Abstract Class
image::developer-guide/log/DataPointAbstractClass.png[]

This abstract class is then extended by concrete class as shown below.

.Example Concrete Data Points
image::developer-guide/log/StatisticsDataPointsClassDiagram.png[]

Through this abstraction we make it easy to extend and include new metrics to track in the future. All that needs to be done is to create a new class that extends `DataPoint` and implements the `calculate` function that takes as input a list of `CompletedWorkout` and does the necessary calculations and sets the results.

==== Implementation
To help explain the implementation of this feature, this portion of the developer guide will examine the command execution of the `log display` command.

For the sake of clarity, this portion of implementation has been broken down into two phases.

Phase 1 will primarily deal with the actual command parsing, execution and the storing of the `startRange` and `endRage` in the model while Phase 2 will then go on to generate statistics based on the `startRange` and `endRange` provided in phase 1.

===== Execution Phase 1
The sequence diagram below describes the flow when the `log display` command is invoked by the user.

.Display Command Invocation Phase 1
image::developer-guide/log/DisplayCommandSequenceDiagramPart1.png[]

This next section goes over in a little more detail how the program unfolds.

Step 1: When the user enters the `log display` command, the `MainWindow#executeCommand()` is executed and in turn calls on the `LogicManager` to help with this.

Step 2: The `LogicManager` then goes through with the normal flow of parsing the command and its parameters and then returning a valid  `DisplayCommand`. This section will not go into details and specifics of this process as it has already been covered above.

Step 3: Once the `Logic Manager` receives the `DisplayCommand`, it will call the concrete implementation of the `DisplayCommand#execute(Model model)` to run the command with the current model.

Step 4: The `execute` function will then go ahead and store the `startRange` and `endRange` in the model via the `Model#setStatisticsDataRange` function.

Step 5: This is where the display command differs from all the other commands. When constructing the `CommandResult` to be returned, the `showReport` flag in `CommandResult` is set to `True`.

Summary:
`startRange` and `endRange` are updated in the current `Model`
The `showReport` flag in `CommandResult` being returned is set to `True`

===== ExecutionPhase 2
Following immediately from phase 1, phase 2 will commence with the return of `CommandResult` to the `MainWindow#executeCommand` function. The sequence diagram below documents the execution flow.

.Example Display Command Invocation Phase 2
image::developer-guide/log/DisplayCommandSequenceDiagramPart2.png[]

Similar to phase 1, this next section will detail the steps taken in a little more detail.

Step 1: When `CommandResult` is returned to the main window, it is checked for the `showReport` to decide if the report page should be shown.

Step 2: Since the `showResult` flag will be set to `True`, the `MainWindow` will call `LogicManager#generateStatistics` to help with the generating of the statistics.

Step 3: The `LogicManager` will then query all the information it requires from the model including the `startRange` and `endRange` described in phase 1.

Step 4: Next, the static function `Statistics#generate` will be invoked. This function will then instantiate new instances of all the `DataPoints` configured.

Step 5: Once instantiated, the `DataPoint#calculate` function will be invoked on all the `DataPoint` objects. This used to calculate and populate each data point with valid data from the list of workouts.

Step 6: Once this is done, a new `StatisticsData` object is created with the data points and the list of workouts and returned.

Step 7: Lastly, the view `StatisticsWindow#show` function is called with the `StatisticsData` previously returned. This renders the new window with the computed statistics.


==== Design Considerations
The following section will detail some of the design consideration and design choices we made while implementing the log statics feature.

==== Flexibility and Sensible Defaults
We wanted to build the statistics feature to be flexible. This is why we decided to include a `startRange` and `endRange` to the `log display` command. This allows users to generate reports for custom datetime ranges.

Due to this flexibility we had to think hard of sensible defaults for this date range if they were not specified. We eventually decided on the flow specified by the activity diagram below.

.Log sensible date range defaults
image::developer-guide/glog/LogDateRangeSensibleDefaults.png[]

* **Alternative 1:** Do not support date range in log command
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Less flexible and metrics used will be limited.

* **Alternative 2 :** Require `startRange` and `endRange` in all display commands
** Pros: Would have to consider sensible defaults
** Cons: More for the user to type if he/she wants to view statistics over all workouts.

* **Alternative 3 :** Allow optional `startRange` and `endRange` use start of epoch for start time and current datetime for end date.
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Statistics generated using the number of days might not make sense.
[Note] For example, the average workout time per day would not make sense since the number of days since epoch will be huge.

* **Alternative 4 (current choice):** Allow optional `startRange` and `endRange` and if not given take earliest start date time and latest end datetime
** Pros: More meaningful metrics and statistics
** Cons: More complicated model and defaults might not seem intuitive at first

===== Defensive Programming
We decided to build these features with security at the forefront. This can be seen in

* The use of optionals and `ifPresent()` functions guards against `NullPointerExceptions` when the user does not provide optional fields.
* `requireNonNull` are frequently used to check for `null` values.
* Strong exception handling when parsing `startRange` and `endRange` in the display command and throwing a `ParseCommandException` if date times provided are not valid in the specified format.

|=======================================================================

The idea of an exercise app alone itself is not particularly challenging.
However, the ZeroToOne team believes that taking a user-experience-first philosophy toward designing an exercise app requires a conscientious design-approach, one that _is_ a challenge.

This is something that we have endeavoured to achieve in this project.

We think that despite the constraints of the CS2103T project, we have managed to demonstrate this to a larger degree.

AB3 deals primarily in the domain of data storage and retrieval. ZeroToOne has taken this one step further, with the ability to:

1. Statefully update new models during a workout session
2. Apply useful statistics across an entire collection of stored data
3. Extend AB3's models to be more functional

Furthermore, on top of the ~16k LoC added to the project, the ZeroToOne team has managed to:

1. Maintain > 70% test coverage
2. Apply SOLID design principles
3. Maintain a consistent quality of the codebase through stringent PR reviews and hooks.

The largest challenge we faced as a team was communication.
Being fast-moving and driven individuals, taking the initiative sometimes meant being able to make decisions for the team as an individual. This meant that it was vital that we were on the same page with our goals and expectations from the project.
Thus, we took more time than usual at the beginning of the project to plan our road-map moving forward, delegating work and defining our expectations clearly.
This meant we were later to start coding and making PRs than other teams (as seen on reposense), which we felt was a more-than-fair trade-off for our team dynamic.

We hope you have enjoyed this journey and learnt as much as we have!
