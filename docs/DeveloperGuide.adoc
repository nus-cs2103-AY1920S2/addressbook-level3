== Introduction

*HireLah!* is a productivity app designed to help busy interviewers manage multiple interview sessions in an orderly
manner. During each interview session, *HireLah!* helps the user to keep track of interviewee information and interview
rubrics in one central location, making the interview process more efficient.
{empty} +
{empty} +

*HireLah!* has the following main features:

. Manage multiple interview sessions.
. Manage interview rubrics for each interview session, including:
.. Attributes to look out for in interviewees.
.. Questions to ask interviewees.
.. Metrics to rank interviewees based on their performance.
. Manage remarks and score entered by the user during an interview.
. Rank interviewees based on particular sets of attributes or a metric after interviews.
. Export interview transcripts as reference.

=== Purpose and Audience
This Developer Guide specifies the architecture, design and implementation of *HireLah!*, as well as our considerations
while designing this app.

It is intended for developers, software testers, and people who would like to enhance this project in
one way or another to understand *HireLah!* on a deeper level.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.


`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/hirelah/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/hirelah/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,


* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add attribute leadership`.

.Component interactions for `add attribute leadership` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/hirelah/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/hirelah/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* After executing each command, performs command-specific view updates as instructed
  by the CommandResult returned by that command.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
// tag::logic[]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/hirelah/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]


.  `Logic` uses either the `NormalParser` or `InterviewParser` class to parse the user command, depending on the app phase stored in the Model.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an attribute).
.  The command execution may also call the storage to save the Model if the command modified the Model.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  The `CommandResult` object then instructs the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying the
list of the current attribute.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("add attribute leadership")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add attribute leadership` Command

NOTE: The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram. +
The exact details of how `AddAttributeCommand` gets the `AttributeList` from `Model`, then modifies the list, then passes the `AttributeList` to `Storage` is left
out in this diagram.

// end::logic[]

// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/hirelah/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the session data including questions, attributes, metrics, and interviewees including their interview transcripts.
* stores the current app state, including whether the user has finalised the attributes and questions, the current phase that
  the app is in (pre-session, in the normal phase or in an interview), the current session and the current interviewee in focus,
  whether being interviewed or whose report is being viewed.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Attribute>`, `ObservableList<Question>`, `ObservableList<Metric>`, `ObservableList<Interviewee>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
// end::model[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/hirelah/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

// tag::storage[]
The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Model data in json format and read it back.
** Save IntervieweeList to interviewee.json
** Save AttributeList to attribute.json
** Save QuestionList to question.json
** Save MetricList to metric.json
** Save Transcripts of individual interviewees to separate json files in /transcript
 - for example an interviewee with id = 1 has his/her transcript saved to transcript/1.json

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `hirelah.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Session Feature

HireLah! differs from AddressBook significantly in that a single user will likely have many sessions,
as compared to just owning a single address book. The app thus provides means of managing multiple sessions from
within the app itself, instead of having to change `preferences.json` to create a new session or switch between sessions.

==== Proposed Implementation

Having multiple sessions and changing between them from within the app means that HireLah! cannot load data from storage
on app startup.

Instead, when the app starts, the ModelManager does not have its components (`IntervieweeList`, `AttributeList`, etc.) loaded,
only `UserPrefs`, and the AppPhase is set to `PRE_SESSION`.

UI displays the `SessionPanel` which shows the available sessions in the "sessionsDirectory" folder.

In `PRE_SESSION` phase, logic uses the `PreSessionParser` which accepts commands to open an existing session or create a new one.

Once a session is chosen, the command calls `Storage#loadSession` which creates new Storage components for the new session
(`IntervieweeStorage`, `AttributeStorage` etc.) that save to the correct session directory. `loadSession` then calls
`Storage#initModelManager`, which loads new Model components (`IntervieweeList`, `AttributeList` etc.), then replaces
the current `ModelManager` components. `AppPhase` is then set to `NORMAL` at which the app starts its usual behavior (adding interviewees etc.).

Finally after refreshing the `ModelManager`, then a new UI `InterviewPanel` is created that observes the new `Model` components.
Since the Model's components have been replaced (a different set of ObservableLists), the UI can only be created at this point else the UI
would be data binding to the wrong lists.

The following activity diagram shows the sequence of initialization of components when a session is opened.

image::SessionActivityDiagram.png[]

From the `NORMAL` phase, the close session command can be given, which simply un-sets the current session in `Model` and returns the
AppPhase to `PRE_SESSION`. Thus the app is ready to open a new session, by resetting the storage components and the Model components,
then creating a new UI `InterviewPanel` again.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How sessions are stored in the app

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Do not store information about sessions in Model. Directly read available sessions
from the `/data` directory (or whatever the user set the "sessionsDirectory" to in `preferences.json`). Scan the
directory again every time the SessionPanel is displayed.
** Pros: Information about the available directories is always synchronized with the filesystem.
It is possible to copy a session from somewhere else into the "sessionsDirectory" and the app will detect it.
** Cons: Simplistic - app naively treats all directories in the "sessionsDirectory" directory as sessions and displays
them as available sessions to the user. If a folder is created externally with invalid data, it will also be treated
as a session, only failing when the user tries to load it.
* **Alternative 2:** Model contains a `SessionList` which tracks what sessions have been created or deleted.
** Pros: User cannot create/delete sessions outside the app, changes to the sessions (new session/delete session)
can be tracked within the app itself rather than repeatedly making IO calls to the filesystem.
** Cons: There is no "single source of truth" as both the file system and the app have a list of sessions, and it is not
straightforward to ensure both are synchronized, eg. if a session data directory is deleted on the file system, the app
will not be aware of it.


===== Aspect: How session data is loaded and saved

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Load session only when a command is given to open a session from a directory.
** Pros: Most user friendly, managing sessions is performed through the same CLI. Memory efficient - data is loaded only
exactly when needed.
** Cons: Complex to implement
* **Alternative 2:** Load all data for all sessions into memory when the app starts, open session
merely selects the current session in focus and displays UI with current session data.
** Pros: Straightforward to implement (All data can be loaded on app starting, need not change implementation from
AddressBook). Switching between sessions is very straightforward.
** Cons: Will be memory intensive as all data even from non-active sessions and past sessions will be loaded. As HireLah!
may include large amounts of data in interview Transcripts, loading all the Transcripts from previous sessions will likely
negatively impact startup timing. Furthermore, it is unlikely that an interviewer needs to access previous interview sessions
data in a current interview, making a lot of the memory consumption wasteful.
** Relevance consideration: It is not often that an interviewer would need to switch between sessions while interviewing for a
specific thing, for example a role in the company.
* **Alternative 3:** Require the user to configure the session to load before app starts up, in `preferences.json`
** Pros: Simplest to implement, yet memory efficient as only the relevant data is loaded
** Cons: Not user friendly - functionality cannot be performed within the app. User cannot discover the functionality on how
to start a new session without consulting the user guide.


// tag::findbestfeature[]
=== Find Best Interviewees Feature
==== Description
When an interviewer wants to take a decision on hiring interviewees, it will be cumbersome for the interviewer to take
a look of the interviewees' score, to take a decision, especially when it comes to a large scale hiring pool. Therefore,
HireLah! provides a Find Best Interviewees feature to show the top interviewees, depending on how many employees the
company need, and what kind of employees does the company desire.

==== Implementation

The Find Best Interviewee feature is facilitated by the `BestCommand`. It has the following fields:

* `numberOfInterviewees`: The number of interviewees that the interviewer wants to hire
* `paramPrefix`: The prefix of the parameter that wants to be used as a comparator between interviewees.
* `paramType`: The type of parameter that wants to be used by the interviewer. The possible values are the following:
`OVERALL`, `METRIC`, and `ATTRIBUTE`.

Given below are several examples of usage scenarios when the user prompts for Best Interviewees:

Scenario 1. When the user provides a command with incomplete compulsory fields (e.g. number of interviewees), the
`BestCommandParser` will throw `ParseException`, informing that the size provided is not an integer because the parser
takes the preamble of the command to get the value for `numberOfInterviewees`.

image::FindBestScenario1SequenceDiagram.png[]

Scenario 2. When the user provides a command with valid fields, yet there are no interviewees that has been interviewed,
a `CommandException` is thrown instead, informing that there is no interviewee that has been interviewed, thus no result
can be shown.

image::FindBestScenario2SequenceDiagram.png[]

Scenario 3. When the user provides a command with multiple parameters that want to be used for a comparator, a `ParseException`
is thrown instead, informing that the user has provided more than 1 parameter.

image::FindBestScenario3SequenceDiagram.png[]

Here is the Full Sequence Diagram for `FindBestCommand` for an ideal case:

image::FindBestSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Getting the best interviewees from Model
To obtain the list of best interviewees, the `BestCommand` has a private method called `getBest` which takes in a `model`,
a `comparator`, and `size`. The `getBest` method retrieves the best interviewees using an Iterator design pattern. It does
the following:

* Retrieve `intervieweeList` and `bestNIntervieweeList` from `model`
* Clear the current `bestNIntervieweeList`
* Since the `comparator` only compares interviewees that have been interviewed, a filter operation needs to be done to
filter out interviewees that have not been interviewed
* Sort the filtered interviewees based on the `comparator`
* Insert the first `size` interviewees to the `bestNIntervieweeList`

There are cases where `getBest` method does not reflect exactly the number of interviewees that the user entered:

* The number of interviewees that has been interviewed is less than the number of interviewees the user prompted. In
this case, all the interviewed interviewees will be shown, in a sorted order based on their score. Therefore, the number
of interviewees shown will be less than what the user entered.

* There are ties between interviewees at the cut-off position. For example, a case where the fifth interviewee, and the
sixth interviewee have the same scores, while the user prompts for the best 5 interviewees. In this case, the sixth interviewee
will also be shown. Therefore, the number of interviewees shown will be more than what the user entered.

Below is the activity diagram to summarize and show how `getBest` method works:

image::GetBestActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to display the best interviewees

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Clears the current content of best interviewees, then add the
best interviewees one by one.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Have a slightly lower execution time.
* **Alternative 2:** Creates a new ObservableList for the best interviewee list, then change the Model's
best interviewees list to point to this list, and the MainWindow's BestIntervieweeListPanel.
** Pros: Have a slightly faster theoretical execution time.
** Cons: The implementation is slightly trickier compared to alternative 1 since it involves multiple components of the app.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
