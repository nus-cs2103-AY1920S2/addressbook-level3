== Introduction

=== Software Overview

FoodieBot is a campus food application which can help users look for food they want, by recommending the canteens nearest to them,
providing randomized food suggestions, helping users plan their budget and provide info on food around
NUS.
FoodieBot is the one stop application to solve all meal decision problems in NUS.

=== Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the architecture and system design of the FoodieBot. This documentation is for anyone who
wishes to understand more about FoodieBot and how it works.

=== Audience

Our target users are students, staff and tourists, in general anyone who comes to or visits NUS.
In particular, for the indecisive user, this application can give a random food suggestion tailored to each user based on their budget and/ or past food selections etcetera.

== Setting up
Our application is being managed by the dependency management tool Gradle.
The project is available at https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F11-3/main. After cloning the repository, you can follow these steps:

For IntelliJ users

1. Run gradle build.
2. Run gradle run.

== Definitions

Defined below are common terminology that will be used frequently throughout this document.

[BLUE]#Context#::
Refers to which state the application is in. This term is used interchangeably with user interface.

== Design
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/Main.java[Main] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/MainApp.java[MainApp]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*Commons*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*UI*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*Logic*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*Model*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*Storage*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an _**interface**_ with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `favorites set 1`.

.Component interactions for `favorites set 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width="600", align="left"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="left"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CanteenListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FoodieBotParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a canteen).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.


NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the FoodieBot data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Canteen>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `FoodieBot`, which `Canteen` can reference. This would allow `FoodieBot` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Canteen` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the FoodieBot data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.foodiebot.commons` package.


=== Design Considerations
==== Aspect: Executing similar tasks but for different objects

e.g. Selecting canteens, stalls, food.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a context class that
executes commands based on the context the user is in.
** Pros: Higher quality user interface, user does not need to remember
so many commands.
** Cons: More difficult to implement.

* Alternative 2: Create different commands for different objects
** Pros: Easier to implement. There will not be any chance
of overlapping commands
** Cons: Reduce quality of user interface as user has to remember many
different commands.


== Implementation

=== List Command
The list command is facilitated by `ListCommandParser`.
It extends `FoodieBotParser` to handle list canteen commands.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a list command:

image::ListActivityDiagram.png[width="400", align="left"]


==== List Command Implementation
It implements the following operations:

* `ListCommand#execute()` -- Updates the canteen list to show all the canteens or filtered by location.

[NOTE]
`ListCommand` extends `Command` with `Command#execute()`.

* `ListCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` -- Checks if the prefixes specified in `parse()` are found in the command entered by the user.
* `ListCommandParser#parse()` -- Identifies if prefixes have been specified and handles them respectively. +
For example, if ListCommand has the nearest block name passed through as a parameter `list f\com1`, ListCommand will filter the canteen list with the given block name with `new ListCommand("com1")`

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:


image::ListSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== List Design Considerations
===== Aspect: User command format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `list f/com`
** Pros: Uses only a prefix to get the intended functionality with list.
** Cons: `f/` is an optional prefix, user might forget that it exists as no error is shown in the command result box
* **Alternative 2:** find nearest `BLOCK_NAME`
** Pros: It is not required to remember any prefix.
** Cons: Can be confusing whether find shows the list of canteens, food, or location of the canteen on campus.
Find has to be followed by nearest otherwise it does not come natural to sort by distance.

=== Budget Command

The `budget` command is implemented by the `BudgetCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to set the budget for the user or to view the current budget of the user.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrate the different scenario for the budget command:

image::BudgetActivityDiagram.png[width="500", align="left"]

==== Budget Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `BudgetCommandParse` object.
. `BudgetCommandParse` then parses the budget command to determine if the action of the budget is `set`, `view` or invalid. +
This process returns a new `BudgetCommand` object.
. The `LogicManager` then access `BudgetCommand#execute()` to determine the type of execution.
. If the action is `set` then the `budget` object saves the user input accordingly.
. If the action is `view` then the budget is retrieved from the storage.
. The `BudgetCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `budget` command:

image::BudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Budget Design Considerations
===== Aspect: `Budget view` shows the transactions screen

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Budget view` displays the current budget in the command feedback panel.
** Pros: Budget can be viewed anywhere in FoodieBot.
** Cons: -

* **Alternative 2:**
** Pros: Can set a realistic budget after looking at past spendings.
** Cons: Increased the coupling of budget and transactions but the intended functionality is different. The user may not want to type
budget to rate a food item.

=== Enter Command

The `enter` command is implemented by either the `EnterCanteenCommand` class or the `EnterStallCommand` class.

These commands are accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to switch the user interface accordingly based on where the user is at.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates the different scenario for the enter command:

image::EnterActivityDiagram.png[width="750", align="left"]

==== Enter Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` which parses the user input into a `ParserContext` to determine if the user is currently in the main context.
. If the user has input `enter` on the main context, it creates a `EnterCanteenCommandParser` object that parses in the user input to determine which canteen to enter.
. Otherwise if the user has Input `enter` on the stall context, it creates a `EnterStallCommandParser` object that parses in the user input to determine which stall to enter
This process returns a new `EnterCanteenCommand` */* `EnterStallCommand` object to the `LogicManager` accordingly.
. The `LogicManager` then access `EnterCanteenCommand#execute()` */* `EnterStallCommand#execute()` to switch the current display to the stalls/food available within the selected canteen/stall.
. Both `EnterCanteenCommand#execute()` and `EnterStallCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `enter` command:

image::EnterSequenceDiagram.png[width="750", align="left"]

==== Enter Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Select command to be used instead of Enter

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `enter`
** Pros: `enter` only handles the viewing of canteens and stalls.
** Cons: Might accidentally type `select` as the `select` command is also implemented in FoodieBot.
* **Alternative 2:** `select`
** Pros: one command to select canteens, stalls and food items.
** Cons: Additional checks for `select` command to detect if a food is chosen, so that it gets added into transactions.

=== Favorites Command

The `favorites` command is implemented by the `FavoritesCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to edit or view the favorite on food items.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates what happens when a user executes the `favorite` command:

image::FavoritesSetActivityDiagram.png[width="250", align="left"]

==== Favorites Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `FavoritesCommandParser` object.
. `FavoritesCommandParser` then parses the user input to determine if the favorite command is `set`, `remove`, or `view`.
This process returns a new `FavoritesCommand` object.
. The `LogicManager` then access `FavoritesCommand#execute()`.
. If `set` was chosen, the selected food item favorite is then updated.
. If `view` was chosen, a list of favorite food items are displayed.
. If `remove` was chosen, the respective food item is removed from the favorite food item list.
. `FavoritesCommand#execute()` creates a new `ActionCommandResult` that extends the `CommandResult` which is to be returned
to the `LogicManager`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `favorites` command:

image::FavoritesSequenceDiagram.png[]


==== Favorites Design Considerations
===== Aspect: `favorites set` operates on stalls and food items

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `favorites set` operate only for food items
** Pros: Only need to maintain one list of food items.
** Cons: Does not allow stalls to be added to favorites, the randomize feature cannot take into account users' stall preferences.
* **Alternative 2:** `favorites set` operate for both stalls and food items
** Pros: Can favorite a single stall rather than adding all the food items in the stall.
** Cons: Cannot identify which food in particular the user likes from the stall. For instance, the user might not like spicy
food and the stall sells a food item with that food characteristic.

=== Filter Command

The `filter` command is implemented by the `FilterCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to filter outputs according to the user input.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates what happens when a user executes the `filter` command:

image::FilterActivityDiagram.png[width="350", align="left"]

==== Filter Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `FilterCommandParser` object.
. `FilterCommandParser` then parse the filter command to determine if the filter output should be by price range or tags +
This process returns a new `FilterCommand` object.
. The `LogicManager` then access `FilterCommand#execute()` which filter the options based on the user input and the context where `filter` is called.
. If the filter option is based on a price, the current context has to be the stall, otherwise an error message is thrown.
. If the option is based on a tag, the filter option will return a list of options based on the current context.
. `FilterCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `filter` command:

image::FilterSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Filter Design Considerations
===== Aspect: `filter` allow partial name tag filters

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `filter` is using the strict match case.
** Pros: Can be accurate in the filter, for example, typing `filter ex` with not
return both food that are expensive and or considered as extras in a combo set.
** Cons: -
* **Alternative 2:** `filter` allows partial name tag search.
** Pros: More lenient in tag search.
** Cons: Long list of filter results.



=== Goto Command

The `goto` command is implemented by the `GoToCanteenCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to display the direction to a canteen based on the user input.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates what happens when a user executes the `goto` command:

image::GotoActivityDiagram.png[width="350", align="left"]

==== Goto Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `GoToCanteenCommandParser` object.
. `GoToCanteenCommandParser` then parses the goto command to determine the canteen name and the current location. +
This process returns a new `GoToCanteenCommand` object.
. The `LogicManager` then access `GoToCanteenCommand#execute()` to retrieve the directions based on the user input.
. `GoToCanteenCommand#execute()` creates a new `DirectionsCommandResults` that extends the `CommandResult` which is to be returned
to the `LogicManager`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `goto` command:

image::GotoSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Goto Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Command format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `goto CANTEEN_INDEX f/CURRENT_LOCATION`
** Pros: Displays the directional instructions only for the current location to the canteen.
** Cons: If no directions are found for the current location to canteen, the user has to try another location by changing
it in the command box.
* **Alternative 2:** `directions` shows directions categorised by blocks. For example,

  //example snippet
  Com1
  1. To Nus Flavors:
  ...
  2. To The Deck:
  ...
  .
  Utown
  3. To Nus Flavors:
  ...
  4. To The Deck:
  ...
  .
  //end of example


** Pros: It is not required to enter any prefix or remember any block name.
** Cons: Display a list of possible directional instructions of current locations to the canteen.
One has to scroll down the list to find the correct list item to show the directions.

=== Randomize Command

The `randomize` command is implemented  by the `RandomizeCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to generate a random stall option based on the user input.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates the different scenario for the randomize command:

image::RandomizeActivityDiagram.png[width="500", align="left"]

==== Randomize Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `RandomizeCommandParser` object.
. `RandomizeCommandParser` then parses the randomize command to separate the prefix if any and return a command object.
In this case a `RandomizeCommand` object is created and returned to the `LogicManager`.
. The `LogicManager` then access `RandomizeCommand#execute()`.
. From `RandomizeCommand#execute()`, `randomize` objects are called to generate a random stall option based on the user input.
. The `RandomizeCommand#execute()` returns a  `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `randomize` command:

image::RandomizeSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Randomize Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Context where `randomize c/` can be called from

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `randomize c/` function is only called from the canteen context.
** Pros: Only allow the canteen index or name shown in the displayed list to be entered with the prefix.
** Cons: Prefix is necessary to indicate that `randomize` works with one canteen only.

* **Alternative 2 :** `randomize c/` can be called anywhere within FoodieBot.
** Pros: -
** Cons: The index might not be bound to the canteen when index is used.

=== Rate Command

The `rate` command is implemented by the `RateCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to rate a food item.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates what happens when a user executes the `rate` command:

image::RateActivityDiagram.png[width="250", align="left"]

==== Rate Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `RateCommandParser` object.
. `RateCommandParser` then parse in the user input to ensure that the `rate` command is only use in the transaction context
and that the inputs are valid. +
This process creates and returns a `RateCommand` object to the `LogicManager`.
. The `LogicManager` then access the `RateCommand#execute()` to retrieve the food item from the transaction storage and
update the rating of the food.
. The `RateCommand#execute()` returns a  `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `rate` command:

image::RateSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Rate Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Rate command allows 0

* **Current choice:** Rating starts from 1.
** Pros: Does not cause confusion whether a rating of 0 means food item is not rated.
** Cons: Cannot remove a rating by setting it to 0.

=== Review Command

The `review` command is implemented by the `ReviewCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to review a food item.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates what happens when a user executes the `review` command:

image::ReviewActivityDiagram.png[width="250", align="left"]

==== Review Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `ReviewCommandParser` object.
. `ReviewCommandParser` then parse in the user input to ensure that the `review` command is only use in the transaction context
and that the inputs are valid. +
This process creates and returns a `ReviewCommand` object to the `LogicManager`.
. The `LogicManager` then access the `ReviewCommand#execute()` to retrieve the food item from the transaction storage and
update the review of the food.
. The `ReviewCommand#execute()` returns a  `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `review` command:

image::ReviewSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Review Design Considerations
===== Aspect: `review` uses a separate screen

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `review 1 this is a message`
** Pros: Able to update a review message conveniently.
** Cons: Review message may be too long which may not fit within the ui card.
* **Alternative 2:** `review INDEX`. FoodieBot shows the review edit screen to type a review message.
** Pros: Remove the need to do any checking on prefixes.
** Cons: A valid command can be entered but not recognised. The user has to accept the change to navigate away.
If the back command is accepted, the user can't enter the single word `back` as the review message.


=== Report Command

The `report` command is implemented by the `ReportCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to review a food item.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates what happens when a user executes the `report` command:

image::ReportActivityDiagram.png[width="350", align="left"]

==== Report Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `ReportCommandParser` object.
. `ReportCommandParser` then parses an optional user input to determine the period of report to display. +
This Process returns a `ReportCommand` object to the `LogicManager`.
. The `LogicManager` then access `ReportCommand#execute()`.
. The `ReportCommand#execute()` retrieves the transaction list from storage and displays a list adapted to a report format within the given period, or all transactions if the period is not given.
. The `ReportCommand#execute()` returns a  `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `report` command:

image::ReportSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Report Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Functionality aspect of report


* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `report`
** Pros: Shows a generated report when the command is entered.
** Cons: -
* **Alternative 2:** `report` command to be combined with `transactions`
** Pros: A report can be generated right from transactions which means
one less command to manage.
** Cons: It is still required to  type `report` after `transactions` command is entered.


=== Select Command

The `select` command is implemented  by the `SelectItemCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to store the current selected food item into the storage as well as to update the current budget of the user.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates what happens when a user executes the `select` command:

image::SelectItemActivityDiagram.png[width="400", align="left"]

==== Select Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `SelectItemCommandParser` object.
. `SelectItemCommandParser` then parses the select command to ensure that the select command is called only on the stall context.
This process also checks if the user input is the food index or the food name that is available in that stall.
Returning a `SelectItemCommand` object to the `LogicManager`.
. The `LogicManager` then access `SelectItemCommand#execute()`.
. The `SelectItemCommand#execute()` retrieves the `Budget` from `ModelManager`.
. The `SelectItemCommand#execute()` retrieves the selected `Food` and creates a `PurchasedFood` object with additional variables.
. The `SelectItemCommand#execute()` adds the `PurchasedFood` to the existing transactions list for storage.
. The `SelectItemCommand#execute()` updates the `Budget` and saves to the `ModelManager`.
. The `SelectItemCommand#execute()` returns a  `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `select` command:

image::SelectItemSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Select Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How food items are selected

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Select food items with `select INDEX`
** Pros: Clean, easy to understand command syntax.
** Cons: More coding required as have to create a separate command class for the select command.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `enter INDEX` command to select food
** Pros: Less coding required, can tag on use of already implemented `enter` command for canteens and stalls.
** Cons: Awkward syntax to _enter_ food instead of _select_food.

=== Transactions Command

The `transactions` command is implemented  by the `TransactionsCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to display the transaction of the given period if stated.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates what happens when a user executes the `transactions` command:

image::TransactionsActivityDiagram.png[width="350", align="left"]

==== Transactions Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `TransactionsCommandParser` object.
. `TransactionsCommandParser` then parses an optional user input to determine the period of transaction report to display. +
This Process returns a `TransactionsCommand` object to the `LogicManager`.
. The `LogicManager` then access `TransactionsCommand#execute()`.
. The `TransactionsCommand#execute()` retrieve the transaction list from storage and display the list within the given period, or all transactions if the period is not stated.
. The `TransactionsCommand#execute()` returns a  `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `transactions` command:

image::TransactionsSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Transactions Design Considerations
===== Aspect: `transactions` should be included as a feature

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `transactions`
** Pros: There is no need to worry about prefixes.
** Cons: To review or rate a food item, it has to always start with the transactions command.
* **Alternative 2:** The food item is reviewed after selecting the canteen and/or stall without having `transactions` command.
** Pros: Convenience in being able to interact with the screen using multiple commands.
** Cons: Ui may look cluttered. Increases difficulty to test.
