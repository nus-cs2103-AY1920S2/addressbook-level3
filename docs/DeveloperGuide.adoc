== Introduction

ExpenseLa is an application for NUS students to be able to track their spending and also gain insights to their monthly spending through data analytics. The data analytics portion of ExpenseLa aims to aid students in viewing and comparing their monthly expenditure on items of different categories such as shopping and groceries, as well as keeping track of their monthly budgets. ExpenseLa records daily incoming and outgoing transactions and constantly keeps track of the user's budget, income and spending. ExpenseLa is optimised for users who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) which works in parallel with a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is an easy, insight-driven application that hopes to help students keep better track of their expenses.

=== Purpose

This developer guide aims to communicate the design and architecture of the software implementation to developers working on ExpenseLa. It also includes future implementations to give developers an idea of the direction that ExpenseLa intends to take on both current and future features. A developer should be able to understand the design, architecture and future goals of ExpenseLa upon reading this guide.

=== Scope

This developer guide specifies the technical and non-technical details of ExpenseLa. The technical aspects include the design and architecture of the software and the non-technical aspects include the user stories, use cases and non-functional requirements.

== Setting up

Pleas refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture (Pang Kim Jin)

In this section, we will be introducing the individual components that form ExpenseLa using various diagrams.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component (Choi Min Suk)

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TransactionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component does the following actions:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.


[[Design-Logic]]

=== Logic component (Hubert Halim)

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

Logic is an interface which `LogicManager` implements, allowing access to the API. The following items are examples on how the LogicManager class can be interacted with:

.  `Logic` uses the `ExpenseLaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a `Transaction`).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `clear` Command
image::ClearSequenceDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component (Pang Kim Jin)

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores an ArrayList which contains the user's command history.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the `ExpenseLa` data.
* stores the `GlobalData` which contains the recurring budget, transactions, total balance, and last updated date.
* stores a `MonthlyData` object which contains budget, expense, and income information set by the user.
* stores a `ToggleView` object that represents the nature of transaction information displayed to the user.
* stores a `Filter` object which represents the filter on the transactions as set by the user
* stores `TransactionList` which contains the list of all transactions
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Transaction>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.



[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component (BenjaminFheng)

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `ExpenseLa` data in json format and read it back.
* can save `GlobalData` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ExpenseLa.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::addtransactions[]
=== Adding transactions (BenjaminFheng)
We allow users to add Expense/Income transactions into ExpenseLa which denotes a positive or negative inflow of money. This section shows how we handle these requests from the user.

==== Implementation

We store every single `Transaction` added by the user into an `ObservableList<Transaction>`, which is a list object in `TransactionList`. We used an `ObservableList` to easily reflect changes to the list by any other component of ExpenseLa using the list.

These are the ways of implementing either a positive or negative Transaction:

* Adding an expense (negative transaction): add
* Adding an income (positive transaction): add i/

These two commands will indicate whether the transaction is positive or negative.

Indicating whether it is a recurring transaction or not will depend if rc/ is present in the input

When inserting a new Expense/Income, the `AddCommandParser` will determine which object to initialise depending on whether the "i/" CLI syntax is present. Afterwhich, the AddCommandParser will parse the values of the transaction depending on whether the respective CLI Syntaxes are present.

* `**Name**` is parsed by `AddCommandParser#parseName(ArgumentMultimap)`, CLI Syntax is n/.
* `**Amount**` is parsed by `AddCommandParser#parseAmount(ArgumentMultimap)`, CLI Syntax is a/.
* `**Date**` is parsed by `AddCommandParser#parseDate(ArgumentMultimap)`, CLI Syntax is d/.
* `**Category**` is parsed by `AddCommandParser#parseCategory(ArgumentMultimap)`, CLI Syntax is c/.
* `**Remark**` is parsed by `AddCommandParser#parseRemark(ArgumentMultimap)`, CLI Syntax is r/.
* CLI Syntax "rc/" will set the transaction to be a monthly recurring transaction.

NOTE: `**ArgumentMultimap**` is a class that stores all the parsed parameters taken from the user input.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add transaction operation works:

image::add-command/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Figure 9. Sequence diagram of how adding a new `Transaction` is processed depending on syntax.

`Transaction` are normally instantiated by `AddCommandParser#parse(String args)`, which attempts to parse the various parameters supplied in args and return either a positive or negative `Transaction`. The following conditions will cause a `ParseException` to be thrown by the parser:

* Missing parameters
* Incorrect syntax (i.e. missing prefix if required)
* Illegal values in parameters (i.e. special character and symbols entered for an integer only field)
* Multiple occurence of parameters which only expects single entry

[NOTE]
Incorrect user input will display `ParseException` message.

We will demonstrate how a `Transaction` is added into `ExpenseLa`:

Step 1. The user executes the command **add n/Pizza a/20.5 d/2020-02-02** to insert a negative transaction with its `Name` set to "Pizza", its `Amount` set to "20.50" and the `Date` set to 02 Feb 2020. The input is now checked and an attempt to parse each parameter occurs:

NOTE: `**Category**` is set to default category `MISC`

Since the user input is valid, the `Transaction` is successfully created and inserted into the transaction list. The transaction list now contains 1 `Transaction` object.

image::add-command/AddTransactionToList1.png[]

Step 2. The user executes **add i/ n/Salary a/3000 d/2020-02-03 r/Monthly Salary c/income rc/ ** to indicate his monthly pay, to insert a positive `**Transaction**`.

NOTE: `**Category**` has a set enum list of values FOOD, SHOPPING, TRANSPORT, GROCERIES, HEALTH, RECREATION, MISC, UTILITIES, INCOME.

NOTE: "rc/" CLI Syntax will set the transaction to be a recurring transaction.

Again, since the input is valid, the positive `Transaction` is successfully added into the transaction list. The transaction list
now contains 2 `**Transaction**` objects.

image::add-command/AddTransactionToList2.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes a command to add a new `Transaction`:

:figure-caption: Figure 10
.Activity diagram of adding a `Transaction` into the transaction list.
image::add-command/AddTransactionActivityDiagram.png[,650]

==== Design considerations

There are many different ways to implement how a transaction is added into `**ExpenseLa**`. In this section, we will justify why we chose to implement it the way we did.

===== Aspect: Differentiating between **positive** and **negative** transactions.
* **Alternative 1: (current choice):** Adding a simple "i/" syntax in the input to differentiate between positive and negative transactions
** Pros: Increases the speed and simplicity of adding a positive or negative transaction. Updating balance in `MonthlyData` information only requires an iteration through
all the transaction amounts in transaction list for calculation.
** Cons: Transactions may not be easily distinguishable as positive or negative transactions on first sight, and may only be distinguished when the transaction amount is inspected.
This may cause slower processing times when extracting all only positive or only negative transactions.

* **Alternative 2: Having separate classes for **positive** and **negative** transactions.
** Pros: Maintains an intuitive design: `**NegativeTransaction**` deducts money and `**PositiveTransaction**` increases money.
** Cons: May incur significant overhead since it is likely that both `**NegativeTransaction**` and `**PositiveTransaction**` will
have very similar methods.

Alternative 1 was chosen because we want the application to be as simple and quick as possible to indicate positive and negative transactions. We focused on separating
the data between months so that the analytics function could calculate data faster.

===== Aspect: Managing how `**RecurringTransactions**` are handled.
* **Alternative 1: (current choice):** Adding a simple "rc/" syntax in the input to differentiate between recurring and non-recurring transactions. "rc/" is quickly parsed by the
AddCommandParser and the transaction is labelled as recurring, which is added to RecurringTransactionsList before the command is added to the TransactionsList in Model.
** Pros: "rc/" is quick and intuitive to indicate during input. Almost no hassle to add the information to RecurringTransactionsList.
** Cons: Inability for existing transactions to set as recurring transactions.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a separate command to indicate which transactions are recurring and the range of when it recurs.
** Pros: Transactions are more customizable for users. Users are able to set recurring transactions to repeat over required months.
** Cons: Users may easily lose track of the transactions that are recurring which will affect their monthly budgeting.

Alternative 1 was chosen because we want to again keep the recurring transactions intuitive and simple. Users can clear their recurring transaction lists whenever
they become invalid, and input the new recurring transactions whenever there are changes

//end::addtransaction[]

// tag::editTransactions[]
=== Editing transactions (BenjaminFheng)
The **edit **functionality modifies details of a specified `**Transaction**` in the existing list and saves
modifications to the external storage file.

==== Implementation
**Edit** mechanism utilizes `**Logic**` operations with the `**EditCommand**` class in place of
`**Command**`, and a unique `**EditCommandParser**` class. The following methods are the implementation for
**edit** operations:

* `EditCommandParser#parse()` - Parses the user's input via the index of the transaction and creates an `**EditCommand**` to execute the command.
* `EditCommand#execute()` - Modifies the `**Transaction**` in `**Model**` with new details and returns a
`**CommandResult**`.
* `TransactionList#setTransaction(Transaction target, Transaction editedTransaction)` - Sets the modified `**Transaction**` to its correct position in the
existing `**TransactionList**`.

Command example: **edit 1 n/[NAME] a/[AMOUNT] r/[REMARK]** will edit the name, amount and remark of transaction of index 1 with
the respective inputs.

Below is an example usage scenario for editing a transaction and explanation of how the **edit** mechanism
behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user starts up the application with an initial list loaded from a sample transaction list.

:figure-caption!:
.Initial transaction list
image::edit-command/editCommand1.png[,650]

Step 2. The user inputs **edit 1 n/Laksa Noodle a/6.00** to edit the transaction (with index 1) name to "Laksa Noodle" and value
to "6". Input is parsed by `EditCommandParser#parse()` which creates an `**EditCommand**`.

Step 3. `EditCommand#execute()` creates a new transaction that reflects the changes and gets the index of current
transaction to be edited.

.New edited transaction in transaction list
image::edit-command/editCommand2.png[,650]

Step 4. `EditCommand#execute()` replaces original transaction in the list with the eddited transaction.

The following activity diagram gives an overview of what ExpenseLa shows the user when executing **edit** command:

:figure-caption: Figure
.Activity diagram for execution of edit command
image::edit-command/EditActivityDiagram.png[,650]

==== Design considerations
This subsection explores some alternative designs considered for certain aspects of the feature's implementation.

===== Aspect: Modifying details of a transaction
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Replace the values of the original transaction with new editd values.
- Pros: Can easily check for inputs that result in no changes.
- Cons: May incur overhead when creating new instance of `**Transaction**`.

* **Alternative 2**: Modify the transaction directly using setter methods.
- Pros: Easy to implement and efficient.
- Cons: Modifying transactions violates the immutability principle, possibly resulting in bugs for UI or
accessing modified transaction fields.

**Alternative 1 chosen** to maintain better coding practices and maintain immutability of transactions for the entire project.
Overhead of creating new `**Transaction**` is insignificant due to relatively small object size.

===== Aspect: Edit transaction by getting it's index or by unique transaction ID
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Get the index of original transaction in the transactions list and edit its values in the list.
- Pros: High certainty of obtaining the correct transaction, editing its values and replacing the same index in the transaction list.
- Cons: If there are too many transactions in the list, it might be tedious to obtain the transaction index by scrolling.

* **Alternative 2**: Iterate through the transactions list and edit the transaction with the correct transaction ID.
- Pros: Virtually impossible to not be able to distinguish between similar transactions of different IDs.
- Cons: Transactions ID would cause significant overhead when looking into each transaction for it's ID.
// end::edit[]


// tag::setbudget[]
=== Setting budgets (Hubert Halim)
We allow the user to maintain a `**Budget**` for the current month and subsequent months. This section details how `**ExpenseLa**` handles
requests made by the user who is trying to set a budget both for a one time and recurring budget. `**Budget**` is contained inside
`**MonthlyData**` object along with `**Expense**` and `**Income**` and application only has 1 `**MonthlyData**` object for the current month.
object looks like:

image::set-budget/BudgetClassDiagram.png[]

If user decides to create a recurring budget, there'll be additional step of updating the `**recurringBudget**` variable in
`**GlobalData**`. `**BudgetCommand**` in addition to modifying `**Budget**` in `**MonthlyData**`, it will also modify `**recurringBudget**`
in `**GlobalData**`.

image::set-budget/GlobalDataClassDiagram.png[]


==== Implementation
Whenever the user attempts to set a new `**Budget**`, `**ExpenseLa**` will create a new MonthlyData object with the given amount.
The application will then call `ModelManager#setMonthlyData(MonthlyData toSet)`. During the creation of the new MonthlyData, the
Budget class will internally check if the budget amount is valid.

We will demonstrate what happens at the back-end whenever the user sets a budget:

Case 1. The user wishes to set their budget to $1500, non-recurring. They execute the command: **budget b/1500**.
The user's entry is checked by `BudgetCommandParser#parse()` and an attempt to parse each parameter occurs:

* `**Budget**` is parsed by `ParseUtil#parseBudget(ArgumentMultimap)`
* `rc/` prefix does not exist, so it is not recurring

NOTE: `**ArgumentMultimap**` is a class that stores all the parsed parameters taken from the user input.

Since the user input is valid, the `**Budget**` is successfully created and inserted into a newly created `**MonthlyData**`.

Case 2. The user made a typo when setting their budget. They execute the command **budget b/1500**.
The user's entry is checked by `BudgetCommandParser#parse()` and an attempt to parse each parameter occurs:

* `**Budget**` is parsed by `ParseUtil#parseBudget(ArgumentMultimap)`

`**Budget**` class then is attempted to be created with the parsed budget amount in the constructor. Internally
Budget will do a validity check using Regex and throw a `**ParseExection**` since amount is not valid.

Case 3. The user wishes to set their budget to $1500, recurring. They execute the command: **budget b/1500 rc/**.
The user's entry is checked by `BudgetCommandParser#Parse()` and an attempt to parse each parameter occurs:

* `**Budget**` is parsed by `ParseUtil#parseBudget(ArgumentMultimap)`
* `rc/` prefix exists, so it is recurring

Since the user input is valid, the `**Budget**` is successfully created and inserted into a newly created `**MonthlyData**`.
BudgetCommand will then modify `**GlobalData**` in `**Model**` by calling `**Logic#setGlobalData**`. `**RecurringBudget**`
value in `**GlobalData**` is now set to the new `**Budget**`

The sequence diagram below depicts what was just elaborated:

.Sequence diagram showing how a `**Budget**` is set
image::set-budget/SetBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Activity diagram showing how a `**Budget**` is set
image::set-budget/SetBudgetActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
We have considered various ways as to how `**Budget**` should be stored in `**ExpenseLa**`. In this section, we will explain the
rationale on our course of actions.

===== Aspect: Make `**Budget**` a part of a bigger class called `**MonthlyData**`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `**Budget**` is a part of `**MonthlyData**` and any `**Budget**` operations is through `**MonthlyData**`
** Pros: Easier to handle `**Budget**` together with other `**MonthlyData**` objects and all data inside is synchronised as it is
handled by a single object.
** Cons: Overhead when modifying `**Budget**` as to maintain immutability, a new `**MonthlyData**` object has to be created.
* Alternative 2: `**Budget**` should be an independent class with a direct reference in `**ExpenseLa**`.
** Pros: More freedom and efficiency in doing modifications on `**Budget**`
** Cons: Need to maintain more references for all different objects.

Again, we went with alternative 1 because it is easier to view `**Budget**` along with the other `**MonthlyData**` components
as a collective. And easier to just handle 1 reference in ExpenseLa.
// end::setbudget[]


// tag::commandHistoryNavigation[]
=== Command History navigation (Hubert Halim)
Users can navigate to previous commands by pressing the up or down button on the keyboard.
Only successful commands are stored in the CommandHistory list and only a maximum of 50 commands can
be stored at a time.

==== Implementation
Every time the user key in a command and press kbd:[Enter], `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered` method will be called.
The method will attempt to execute the command by calling `CommandExecutor#execute` method. That method throws an error
if command is invalid. So if the command is valid, the `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered` method will call
`Logic#deleteCommandFromHistory` to delete the command if it exists in the current command history.
It will then call `Logic#addToCommandhistory` to add the command to the command history as its latest entry.
Both commands for add and delete takes in an integer variable called `offset`. This variable is maintained by `CommandBox`
and determines which command the user is currently at in the command history.
Offset starts from -1 indicating `CommandBox` is empty and resets to -1 every time a successful command is entered

`Command History` is an array list that resides in `ModelManager` object. It can be accessed through `Logic` by calling

The diagrams below depicts what was just elaborated:

.Sequence diagram showing what happens when presses Up/Down button
image::command-history/CommandHistoryNavigateSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Activity diagram showing what happens when presses Up/Down button
image::command-history/CommandHistoryNavigateActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Design considerations
We have considered various ways as to how to implement `**CommandHistory**` to support navigation to previous commands
Since we need to capture keyboard events when user press the keyboard, we decided to implement the event listener and handler
in `**CommandBox**` component as it is more convenient because when a keyboard event is captured, the app can straight away
modify the `**TextField**` in `**CommandBox**`. Since the event when user enter a command is also handled in `**CommandBox**`
and we only store successful commands in `**CommandHistory**`, we wait for execution of the Command by `**CommandExecutor**`,
if it is successful, the String for the command is added to, otherwise due to the error thrown and caught somewhere else, the
command is not stored.
// end::commandHistoryNavigation[]


=== Filtering Transactions (Pang Kim Jin)

The `Filter` command allows the user to bring up a list of `Transaction`, and filter it by either category, month,
or both at the same time. This is implemented by using a predicate for category and another predicate for month,
both of which inheriting from `Predicate<Transaction>` to filter the `Transaction`.

==== Implementation

`FilterCommand` is instantiated by `FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)` method, which parses the arguments supplied in the user
command to return a `FilterCommand` object.

The below sequence diagram depicts the interactions within the `Logic` component for the execute("filter c/FOOD m/2020-04") call:
image:FilterSequenceDiagram.png[]

The below scenario shows a typical usage of the filter feature:

Step 1: Upon application launch, the filter for all categories and the current month is automatically applied.
image:filter/Filter_SS_1.PNG[]

Step 2: User executes the command `filter c/food m/2020-02` to bring up transactions in the category "FOOD" for the month
of February 2020. (Note: The command in the command line disappears upon hitting Enter, the command in the command line
is purely for illustration purposes).
image:filter/Filter_SS_2.PNG[]

Step 3: The `FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)` parses the arguments.

Step 4: Since user input is correct and the arguments are parsed, a new `FilterCommand` object is created by the
`FilterCommandParser`.

Step 5: The `FilterCommand` object will use a `Predicate<Transaction>` based on the specified category, month, or both, to filter
the list of transactions.

Step 6: The list of filtered transactions is brought up. The filter category and month UI will also update accordingly
to show the category and month that the transactions are filtered by.

The below activity diagram gives an overview of the command execution:
image:filter/FilterActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: Using `Predicate` to improve extendability of the `Filter` feature in the future.*

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a new `Predicate<Transaction>` for each new filter type
** Pros: Greater flexibility can be provided for each filter type since different filter types have different requirements (e.g. Month vs Category)
** Cons: Tedious to implement a new class for each new type of filter
* Alternative 2: Use a single `Predicate<Transaction>` to filter for all filter types
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Prone to being inflexible for extensions

We decided to go with Alternative 1 since the current filter feature supports increasing the number of filter types
- on top of the current category and month filters. Despite having a different `Predicate` for each filter type, we use
a composed `Predicate` comprising of both `Predicate` s, making it much easier to support extensions to this feature.

==== Proposed Extension

We plan to enhance the filter feature to support other arguments in the command to filter by different types such as
price range or date range. This allows the user to have greater flexibility and have a better understanding of his/her
expenses.

The design consideration mentioned earlier hence facilitates this proposed extension, reducing the difficulty of such a
future implementation.

=== Chart Analytics (Choi Min Suk + Pang Kim Jin)

The *toggleview* command allows the user to switch between viewing the list of 'Transactions' and viewing an analysis of
his expenditure.

In the expenditure analysis view we have a bar chart to show expenditure breakdown by date as well as a pie chart to
show expenditure breakdown by category.


==== Implementation

`MainWindow` decides whether to show a list of transactions or chart analysis based on `ToggleView#isViewList`, by accessing
`Logic#getToggleView()`.

Here is a Class Diagram for the implementation of `ToggleView`:

image:chart-analytics/ToggleViewClassDiagram.png[]

The *ToggleView* mechanism utilizes `Logic` operations with the `ToggleViewCommand` class in place of `Command`. The following
methods are concrete implementations for the *toggle* operation:

* `ToggleViewCommand#execute()` - Modifies the `ToggleView` in `Model` to view list of transactions or view analytics, and
returns a `CommandResult` (<<Design-Logic, Step 4 of Logic>>).
* `ToggleView#switchIsViewList()` - Modifies the boolean value `isViewList` in `ToggleView` to the negation of it's
current value.
- This `ToggleView` is wrapped in `ExpenseLa` and its `switchIsViewList()` is called through
`ExpenseLa#switchToggleView()`.
- `ExpenseLa#switchToggleView()` is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#switchToggleView()`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates **toggleview** command execution:

.Sequence diagram showing execution of **toggleview**
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Example of usage
Given next is an example and explanation of how the **ToggleView** mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user starts up the application with an initial list loaded from external storage file. The diagram here
depicts the example list used throughout this scenario.

:figure-caption!:
.Example list on startup
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep1.png[,650]

Step 2. The user inputs **toggleview** to change the view from list of transactions to chart analysis.

.User input for toggle view
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep2.png[]

Step 3. `ToggleViewCommand#execute()` switches `isViewList` of `ToggleView` from true to false.

.isViewList of ToggleView switched from ToggleViewCommand#execute()
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep3.PNG[]

Step 4. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` checks the boolean value of isViewList in ToggleView, which is false,
and displays chart analysis.

.Switched from showing list of transactions to chart analysis
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep4.png[,650]

Step 5. User inputs **toggleview** again to change view back to list of transactions.

image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep2.png[]
.Switched from showing list of transactions to chart analysis
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep1.PNG[,650]

Step 6. User can set filter to a certain month to view a different kind of bar chart.

.Example of stacked bar chart of expenditure for a certain month
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep6.PNG[,650]

The following code snippet from `MainWindow#executeCommand()` checking of the boolean value of isViewList in ToggleView,
and deciding whether to show a list of transactions of chart analysis, and what bar graph to show:

[source, java]
----
// The if else statement checks the value of isViewList from ToggleView
if (logic.getToggleView().getIsViewList()) {
    // Creates ui for list of transactions
    transactionListPanel = new TransactionListPanel(logic.getFilteredTransactionList());
    transactionListAndChartAnalyticsPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(transactionListPanel.getRoot());
} else {
    // Creates ui for chart analysis
    // Calls logic.getIsFilterMonth() to check if the filter is set to a specific month or not, to decide which bar graph to build
    chartAnalyticsPanel = new ChartAnalyticsPanel(logic.getFilteredTransactionList(), logic.getIsFilterMonth());
    transactionListAndChartAnalyticsPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(chartAnalyticsPanel.getRoot());

==== Design considerations
This section shows some of the design considerations taken when implementing the undo and redo features.

===== Aspect: Design used to implement toggelview feature

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a ToggleView Class to keep a boolean value of isViewList to keep track of
showing list of transactions or chart analysis.
** Pros: Easily extendable next time to accommodate more different kind of views by changing boolean to possibly enum.
** Pros: Easy to implement functions to change values in `ToggleView` object, which allows easy extendability next time also.
** Cons: Needs to implement many functions through `Logic` and `Model`.
* Alternative 2: Create a boolean value in `Model` to track whether to show list of transactions or chart analysis.
** Pros: Easy implementation and checking of boolean value by `MainWindow` to check which view to show.
** Cons: Not extendable next time when trying to accommodate different kind of views.

Alternative 1 was chosen because it is easily extendable, in case we want to improve or develop on the feature in the
future. It also follows better OOP principles, making the code much neater and understandable.

=== Export (Choi Min Suk)

The *export* command allows user to export currently filtered transactions to a csv file, in case he would like to use
the data for his own analysis.

==== Implementation

`ExportCommand` is instantiated by `ExpenseLaParser#parseCommand(String userInput)`, which attempts to split the userInput
into the command word and its parameters. Since `ExportCommand` does not require any arguments, it is instantiated directly.


`ExportCommand` obtains the filtered list of transaction to export using `Model#getFilteredTransactionList()`, which then
attempts to create a csv file in the current directory using the attributes of each transaction.

The sequence diagram below shows how the execution of *export* is like:

.Sequence diagram of how *export* command is applied at the back-end.
image::export/ExportSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following conditions will cause a `**CommandException**` to be thrown by the command:

. Empty filtered transaction list
. Failure in creating the file
. Failure in writing to the file (Possibly due to the directory changing while the command is being executed)

The image below shows how the csv file looks when user executes *export* command successfully:

.List of transactions in a csv file opened in Microsoft Excel
image::export/ExportCsv.PNG[,650]

==== Proposed extension
In the near future, we plan to enhance the export feature. We want to improve the export command to take in view as a
possible argument, thus allowing the user to choose between exporting list of transactions or the chart analysis. The
user can use the chart analysis generated for visual presentations, especially if the expense tracker is for a business.

The image below shows how a possible future implementation of this feature could look like:

image::export/ExportBarGraph.PNG[,550]
.Expected images to be exported when *export chartanalysis*
image::export/ExportPieChart.PNG[,550]

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption (Pang Kim Jin)

Given the sensitive nature of the information provided by users, we would like to safeguard the information provided by
our users through encryption. Naturally, the information would be encrypted and decrypted in the back-end without the user
requiring to do any of the encryption, decryption, or even any knowledge of how it works.

==== Proposed Implementation

We thus propose a `Keystore` module to contain authorisation certificates or public key certificates
interacting with the `Logic` and `Storage` modules. With this addition, the following architecture diagram
gives an overview of how it would fit in:

image::DataEncryptionClassDiagram.png[]

The `Keystore` module would have a `KeystoreManager` which implements the following methods:

* `KeystoreManager#setCipher(Cipher cipher)` - sets the `Cipher` for encryption usage.
* `KeystoreManager#encryptExpenseLa(ExpenseLa expenseLa)` - encrypts the given `ExpenseLa` object with the encryption cipher set with every
call to `LogicManager#execute()` method.
* `KeystoreManager#decryptExpenseLa(ExpenseLa expenseLa)` - Decrypts the encrypted json file upon application launch.

The following class diagram provides a depiction of the above:

image::DataEncryptionClassDiagram2.png[]

NOTE: `KeystoreManager#encryptExpenseLa(ExpenseLa expenseLa)` and `KeystoreManager#decryptExpenseLa(ExpenseLa expenseLa)`
will be using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 256) encryption algorithm.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect: Encryption Algorithm*

* Alternative 1: Data Encryption Standard
** Pros: Simpler to implement encryption and decryption
** Cons: Weaker security, easy to brute force
* Alternative 2 (current choice) : Advanced Encryption Standard
** Pros: 256 bit key is exponentially more secure than DES' 56 bit key
** Cons: Harder to implement


=== [Proposed] ExpenseLa Monthly Statement (Pang Kim Jin)

Similar to how banks issue a statement of account, we believe that it would be helpful to provide
our users with an overview of their expenses. This statement would include the user's balance,
budget, expense, income, and transactions in a user specified time frame.The user can choose to include/exclude certain
transactions based on their categories or dates.

==== Proposed Implementation

To generate the statement, we propose a `StatementCommand` that extends `Command` and works with `ModelManager` just like
all other commands, as depicted in the following diagram:

image::StatementCommandClassDiagram.png[]

* The user uses the `FilterCommand` to  filter the list of transactions to show only the transactions with the
user's preferred category and transaction month
* Then `StatementCommand#execute()` will retrieve the `FilteredList` of transactions
and generate a Portable Document Format (PDF) file with Java's PDFWrite API.

Below is a truncated example of the PDF ExpenseLa statement:

image::statement/Statement.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: Time and Nature of Transactions to Export*

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Users get to choose when to generate their statement and which month and categories of
transactions to include.
** Pros: Users get a statement tailored according to their needs.
** Cons: Users may forget to include certain types of transactions.
* Alternative 2: At the end of every month, a statement of all transactions and user information is exported
** Pros: Users get a comprehensive view of their expenses
** Cons: Users may be overloaded with information

Ultimately we chose Alternative 1 as we prioritise our user's freedom of choice and we understand that not all transactions
may be relevant for the purposes of exporting the statement.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
