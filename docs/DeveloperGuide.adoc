== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* <<Design-Services,*`Services`*>>: Interacts with an external Application Programming Interface (API) to obtain data for the App.

Each of the first four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `module delete CS1010` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`, `StatusBar` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow` (excluding `AvatarImage`), inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`].

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `CourseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ModuleDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Course Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Requirement>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` that can be 'observed'.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Course Book`, which `Module` can reference.
This would allow `Course Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Module` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/igrad/memo/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Course Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `iGrad.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Course Feature

A `CourseBook` contains only one course information.

==== Implementation

.Structure of CourseInfo Class
image::CourseInfoClassDiagram.png[]
A course consists of three information: Name, CAP, and SemsLeft. One course should only have one name,
and one CAP.

The course related commands that can be called are:

* `course edit` - edits name of existing course in the course book
* `course delete` - deletes existing course and all information in the course book
* `course achieve` - calculates CAP needed to maintain each semester to achieve overall CAP targer

Here is how the courseInfo class updates when name of course is edited:

.Sequence Diagram when editing course name.
image::CourseEditSequenceDiagram.png[]
When a user edits name of a course, the user has to specify the prefix `/n` for name.
Then the application proceeds to do the following steps:

Step 1: The CourseEditCommandParser is called to parse the CourseEditCommand with the n/ prefix.

Step 2: The CourseEditCommand is executed to set the new course name to the model.

Step 3: The new course name is set in the course book.

=== Adding Modules from NUS Mods

==== Implementation

The automatic filling in of module details on addition of a new module is facilitated by `NusModsRequester`.
It creates a new instance of `GetRequestManager` in order to make a request to link:https://nusmods.com/[NUSMods].
Upon receiving a response, it creates an instance of `JsonParsedModule`.

`JsonParsedModule` parses the JSON object given in the response of the initial request and stores the following values:

* `title` e.g. Software Engineering
* `moduleCode` e.g. CS2103T
* `credits` e.g. 4
* `description` e.g. This module introduces the necessary conceptual and analytical tools for systematic and rigorous development of software systems...

The above process is initiated by `AddAutoCommandParser` which then converts a `JsonParsedModule` instance to a `Module`.

The sequence diagram below provide further insight into its execution:

image::AutoAddSequenceDiagram.png[]

As NUSMods might not always have the latest data for the current academic year, a follow up request is made when an empty response is received.

The following activity diagram illustrates this:

image::AutoAddActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

As with all network requests, this feature might not work as intended in certain circumstances. Possible cases are:

[start=1]
1. High Network Congestion
2. Poor Network Connection
3. NUSMods Offline

In such situations, the user would be prompted to manually fill in the necessary details for a module. The compulsory
and optional fields are shown in the class diagram below:

image::ModuleClassDiagram.png[]

**Pros**

1. Time taken to add a module with accurate `moduleCode`, `title` and `credits` is reduced by a factor of **0.85** (statistic derived from user trials).

**Cons**

1. Successful addition of module is not always guaranteed.

=== Requirements Feature
Within a course, there are multiple requirements to be tracked.

==== Implementation
.The Requirement class

.Structure of the Requirement class.
image::RequirementClassDiagram.png[]
A requirement consists of three components: title, credits and unique module list.
The unique module list implies that each requirement stores modules assigned to that requirement.
Multiple requirements can exist in the course book at any one time.

The requirement-related commands that can be called are:

* `requirement add` - adds a new requirement to the course book
* `requirement edit` - edits an existing requirement in the course book
* `requirement delete` - deletes an existing requirement from the course book
* `assign` - assigns a module to the requirement

Here is how the requirement class updates when a requirement is added:

.Sequence Diagram when adding a requirement.
image::RequirementAddSequenceDiagram.png[]

When the user adds a requirement, the user has to specify two prefixes: `n/` for title and `u/` for credits value (number of credits needed to fulfill for the requirement).
Then, the application proceeds to do the following steps

Step 1: The RequirementAddCommandParser is called to parse the RequirementAddCommand with the `n/` and the `u/` prefixes into a new requirement.

Step 2: The RequirementAddCommand is executed to add the new requirement to the model. In this step, the following check is performed:

* Check if a requirement with the same title already exists in the course book.

Step 3: The new requirement is added to the course book.

=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCourseBook`.
It extends `CourseBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedCourseBook#commit()` -- Saves the current course book state in its history.
* `VersionedCourseBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous course book state from its history.
* `VersionedCourseBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone course book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCourseBook()`, `Model#undoCourseBook()` and `Model#redoCourseBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `VersionedCourseBook` will be initialized with the initial course book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single memo book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

<<<<<<< HEAD Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th module in the course book.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCourseBook()`, causing the modified state of the course book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted course book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new module.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCourseBook()`, causing another modified address course book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCourseBook()`, so the course book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the module was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCourseBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous course book state, and restores the course book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial course book state, then there are no previous course book states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCourseBook()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCourseBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the course book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest course book state, then there are no undone course book states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCourseBook()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the course book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCourseBook()`, `Model#undoCourseBook()` or `Model#redoCourseBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCourseBook()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all course book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire course book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of course book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice.
For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedCourseBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
