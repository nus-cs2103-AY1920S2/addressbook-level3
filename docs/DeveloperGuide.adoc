[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

==== Design pattern and data flow

The App is built following the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[Model-View-Controller] design pattern.

In addition, the App's data flow is unidirectional. That is, all user interactions in `View` will trigger an appropriate handler in `Logic`, which in turn updates `Model` and `Storage`.
Any data/state changes in `Model` will then propagate back to `View` automatically through https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/binding/jfxpub-binding.htm[JavaFX's Property and Binding].

In short, the App's data flow can be summarized as: +
`View` -> `Logic` -> `Model` + `Storage` -> `View`

==== Architecture-level components

Overall, the App consists of four components:

* <<Design-View,*`View`*>>: View of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Business logic of the App.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: In-memory representation of the App's data/state.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

In addition, <<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `new -t Notably -b Lorem ipsum`.

[[Design-View]]
=== View component

.Structure of the View Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/view/View.java[`View.java`]

The View consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `View` component uses JavaFx framework. The layout of these View parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/view/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `View` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the View can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

.Architecture of Logic
image::LogicArchitectureDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]


`Logic` consists of 3 subcomponents:

* <<Design-NotablyParser,*`NotablyParser`*>>: Main parser of the App, deals with user command execution.
* <<Design-SuggestionEngine,*`SuggestionEngine`*>>: Deals with suggestions generation.
* <<Design-CorrectionEngine,*`CorrectionEngine`*>>: Deals with auto-correction.

[[Design-NotablyParser]]
==== NotabyParser component

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

.  `Logic` uses the `NotablyParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `List<Command>` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a Note).
.  The updated model/data structure will automatically be reflected on to the `View`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete cs2103")` API call.

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-SuggestionEngine]]
==== SuggestionEngine component

TODO: EDIT BELOW!

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the View can be bound to this list so that the View automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
