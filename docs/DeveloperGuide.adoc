== Introduction

=== Purpose
This document describes the architecture and system design of Mod Manager.

=== Audience
The developer guide is for software developers, designers and testers who wants to understand the architecture and system design of Mod Manager.

== Setting Up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components generically interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `some command`.

.Component Interactions for `some command` Command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI Component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `HelpWindow`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic Component
//tag::logic[]
[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  `ModManagerParser` will then create the appropriate parser object to continue parsing the command. This parser object will then
determine the specific kind of the user command and let a subtype parser of it do the rest of the parsing work.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a facilitator).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

This logic component design is chosen because we have many commands that can be grouped with the same keyword (e.g. `mod`, `task`, `lesson`, etc).
The design provides good abstraction for the developers without cluttering a particular parser class.
//end::logic[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model Component
//tag::model[]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `DoableActionList` capturing effects of user commands that can add/edit/delete entities, i.e. what is added, edited, or deleted.
* stores the Mod Manager data.
* exposes many unmodifiable `ObservableList` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
//end::model[]

More detailed designs of important sub-components are below.

//tag::mod-package[]
==== Module (Lu Shing)
.Structure of the Module Package
image::ModulePackageClassDiagram.png[]

* The `Module` package contains a concrete class `Module`.
* A `Module` contains a `ModuleCode` and a `Description` of the module.
* A `UniqueModuleList` comprises of instances of `Module`.
//end::mod-package[]

==== Facilitator (Lu Shing)
.Structure of the Facilitator Package
image::FacilitatorPackageClassDiagram.png[]

* The `Facilitator` package contains a concrete class `Facilitator`.
* A `Facilitator` contains a `Name`, `Email` and `Office`.
* A `Facilitator` also contains at least one `ModuleCode` to indicate which `Module` the facilitator belongs to.
* A `UniqueFacilitatorList` comprises of instances of `Facilitator`.

==== Lesson (Lu Shing)
.Structure of the Lesson Package
image::LessonPackageClassDiagram.png[]

* The `Lesson` package contains a concrete class `Lesson`.
* A `Lesson` contains a `DayAndTime` which indicates which day of the week and the time the lesson is on.
* A `Lesson` also contains a `LessonType` and a `ModuleCode` to indicate which `Module` the lesson belongs to.
* A `LessonList` comprises of instances of `Lesson`.

==== Task (Nhat)
//tag::task-package[]
.Structure of the Task Package
image::TaskPackageClassDiagram.png[]

* The `Task` package contains an abstract class `Task`. It has two concrete subclasses: `ScheduledTask` and `NonScheduledTask`.
* A `ScheduledTask` contains a `TaskDateTime` to indicate its date and time.
* A `NonScheduledTask` represents a task whose date and time are not specified, so it does not contain a `TaskDateTime`.
* Any `Task` would contain a `ModuleCode` to indicate which `Module` it is a task of.
* A `UniqueTaskList` comprises of instances of `NonScheduledTask` and `ScheduledTask`.
//end::task-package[]

==== Calendar
* The `Calendar` package contains a concrete class `Calendar` which represents a calendar date.

==== DoableAction (Nhat)
//tag::doable-package[]
.Structure of the Action Package
image::DoableActionClassDiagram.png[]

* `DoableAction` is an interface of actions that can be undone/redone in Mod Manager, stored in the `Action` package.
* Actual implementations of `DoableAction` are `ModuleAction`, `LessonAction`, `FacilAction`, and `TaskAction`, each of which
has a `DoableActionType` value to assist how the undo/redo process is carried out.
* A `DoableActionList` comprises of instances of classes mentioned above.
//end::doable-package[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage Component

// tag::storage[]
.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Mod Manager data in json format and read it back.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== General Features

There are a few general features implemented to help users improve their workflow with Mod Manager.

These are: `undo` and `redo` feature, navigating through past commands with up/down keys, `clear` command, and `help` command.

==== Implementation Details

//tag::general-features[]
===== Undo/Redo command (Nhat)
Each add/edit/delete action is captured as a `DoableAction`. Every time a `DoableAction` is performed, it will be recorded
to the `DoableActionList`. Thus, after each add/edit/delete command execution, a suitable `DoableAction` will be be
created and recorded. Other sections might not mention this again.

`DoableActionList` stores two `Stacks` of `DoableAction` called `primary` and `secondary`.

The mechanism of `undo` is given below. For `redo`, it is exactly the same.

1. The user executes the `undo` command. The `UndoCommandParser` creates an `UndoCommand`.
2. `LogicManager` executes the `UndoCommand`.
3. `ModelManager` calls `undo` method of `DoableActionList` to reverse the effect of the most previous `DoableAction`.

===== Navigating through past commands with up/down keys (Nhat)
This feature applies to each usage session. The mechanism is below.

1. Each time the user types anything and presses kbd:[Enter] in the `CommandBox`, the input will be saved to the `UserInputHistory`.

2. When an `up` key is pressed, the latest previous input will be retrieved from `UserInputHistory` and display at the
`CommandBox`. If there are no previous inputs to show, the `CommandBox` will either stay the same or become empty.

3. When a `down` key is pressed, the most previously input seen by pressing `up` will be shown at the `CommandBox`. When
there are no inputs to show, the `CommandBox` will become empty.

===== Clear command
This command simply clears all the data from the system. The action is not undo-able. Its mechanism is simple.

1. The user inputs a clear command.

2. `ModelManager` will replace the current `ModManager` instance with a newly created one that doesn't contain any data.

===== Help command
This command will pop up a window showing a link to the User Guide. The user simply inputs a help command and the window
will appear.

==== Design Considerations (Nhat)

===== Aspect: Undo/Redo Implementation
* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire database every time an add/edit/delete action occurs.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: High memory consumption during a usage session, and potentially causing lag if the database is huge.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Each feature that involves adding/editing/deleting data to the database would have
a corresponding class extending `DoableAction`. For example, Module Management feature would have a `ModuleAction` class
that extends `DoableAction`. This special class will contain specific details on how to revert the effect of each
add/edit/delete action.
** Pros: Low memory consumption during a usage session, leading to potentially more consistent performance.
** Cons: Difficult to implement.

Alternative 2 was chosen as it could provide better performance with a huge database, and partly because our team enjoyed
some extra challenge.
//end::general-features[]

=== Module Management Feature

// tag::module[]
// tag::mod[]

==== Design Considerations (Zi Xin)

===== Aspect: Support for editing module code
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow users to edit the module code of a module.
** Pros: More flexibility for users.
** Cons: More complex implementation as the classes, tasks and facilitators all store module codes and have to be edited too.
* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to only edit the description of a module.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: More rigid for users.

Alternative 1 is chosen as it gives users more flexibility and is more user-friendly.
// end::module[]

//tag::class[]

==== Design Considerations (Heidi)

===== Aspect: Prefix of day and time
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have one prefix for all three `day`, `startTime` and `endTime` fields.
** Pros: User types less.
** Cons: When user wants to edit one field only, user have to key in other unnecessary details.
* **Alternative 2:** Have one prefix each for `day`, `startTime` and `endTime` fields.
** Pros: Easier to parse and less invalid inputs to take note of. User can also edit any field.
** Cons: More prefixes to remember and command will be very lengthy.

//end::class[]

=== Task Management Feature
//tag::taskOverview[]
The task management feature manages the tasks in Mod Manager and is represented by the `Task` abstract class with implementing class
`ScheduledTask` for a `Task` with a time and `NonScheduledTask` for a `Task` with no specified time.
A task has a `Description`, an optional `TaskDateTime`, and exactly one `ModuleCode`.
A `Module` with that `ModuleCode` of the task should exist in Mod Manager.

A `Task` object also has a unique ID number specified by its `ModuleCode` and a 3-digit number ranging from
100 to 999. Since part of the ID is the `ModuleCode`, a `Task` object only needs to store an extra `taskNum`.
Generating task number is done through static calls to methods of `TaskNumManager`.

It supports the following operations:

* `add` - Adds a task to a `Module` in Mod Manager.
* `edit` - Edits the information of a task in Mod Manager.
* `delete` - Deletes a task from the `Module` and Mod Manager.
* `done` - Marks a task as done in Mod Manager.
* `list` - Shows a list of all tasks across all `Module` s in Mod Manager.
* `module` - Shows a list of all tasks for a specified `Module` in Mod Manager.
* `undone` - Shows a list of all undone tasks in Mod Manager.
* `find` - Finds tasks in Mod Manager by its description.
* `search`- Searches for tasks that occur on the specified date, month, or year in Mod Manager.
* `upcoming` - Finds upcoming tasks (for tasks with a specified time) in Mod Manager. `[coming in v2.0]`

//end::taskOverview[]
==== Implementation Details

===== Adding a task (Nhat, Bao)
// to extend on Task, ScheduledTask and NonScheduledTask
The add task feature allows users to add a task to Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `TaskCommandParser`, `TaskAddCommandParser` and `
TaskAddCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTask()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `task add` mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the `task add` command and provides the module code, the description of the task (both compulsory),
and a time (optional), which consists of a date (for example, `15/04/2020`) or a date and time (`15/04/2020` and `23:59`) of the task to be added.
2. `TaskAddCommandParser` creates a new `Task` based on the module code, description, and time (if provided).
3. `TaskAddCommandParser` creates a new `TaskAddCommand` based on the task.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `TaskAddCommand`.
5. `ModManager` adds the task to the `UniqueTaskList`.
6. `ModelManager` updates the `filteredTasks` in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `task add` command works:

.Sequence Diagram for `task add` Command
image::TaskAddSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `TaskCommandParser`, `TaskAddCommandParser` and `TaskAddCommand` should end at
the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `task add` command:

.Activity Diagram for `task add` Command
image::TaskAddActivityDiagram.png[]

//tag::task-edit[]
===== Editing a task (Nhat)
The `task edit` command allows user to edit a task in Mod Manager.
The fields that can be edited are: description, and task date and time.
This feature is facilitated by `TaskCommandParser`, `TaskEditCommandParser` and `TaskEditCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setTask()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `task edit` mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes the task edit command and provides the `moduleCode` and the `taskNum` of the task to edit,
and the fields to be edited.
2. `TaskEditCommandParser` creates a new `EditTaskDescriptor` with the fields to be edited.
3. `TaskEditCommandParser` creates a new `TaskEditCommand` based on the `moduleCode` and `taskNum`, and `EditTaskDescriptor`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `TaskEditCommand`.
5. `TaskEditCommand` retrieves the `moduleCode` and `taskNum` of the `task` to be edited, and then retrieves the actual `task`
from `ModManager`.
6. `TaskEditCommand` creates a new `Task`. Since the user can use `task edit` to remove a task's date/time, a special `TaskDateTime` has been set to `01/01/1970` to
help with the `edit` command. Essentially, if the `EditTaskDescription` carries such date, the newly created `Task` will
not have a `TaskDateTime` and be of type `NonScheduledTask`. An assumption about user inputs is made here: no one will
actually input `01/01/1970` as a date.
7. `ModManager` sets the existing `task` to the new `task` in the `UniqueTaskList`.
8. The `edit` action is recorded in `ModelManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `TaskEditCommand` is created after the parsing steps:

image::TaskEditCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `TaskCommandParser` and `TaskEditCommandParser` should end at
the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The execution of a `TaskEditCommand` is described below.

1. `List<Task> current` is retrieved by calling `model.getFilteredTaskList`.
2. The correct `taskToEdit` is retrieved from `current` by turning it into a `stream` and use the `reduce` method.
3. The `editedTask` is created using method `createEditedTask`.
4. `model` sets `taskToEdit` to `editedTask` in the `UniqueTaskList` via calls to `ModManager`.
5. An `editTaskAction` is created and added to `model`.
6. A `CommandResult` is returned.

4. `model` deletes `taskToDelete` in the `UniqueTaskList` via calls to `ModManager`.
5. A `deleteTaskAction` is created and added to `model`.
6. A `CommandResult` is returned.

==== Design Considerations (Bao)

===== Aspect: The association between `Module` and `Task`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**

Each `Task` can have a unique `ModuleCode` tag,
which uniquely identifies the `Module` it belongs to. This is an *aggregation* relationship,
which is weaker than composition in our second alternative.

.Class Diagram: A `Task` acts as a container for the `ModuleCode` object of a `Module`. `ModuleCode` objects can survive without a `Task` object.
image::ModuleTaskAggregationDiagram.png[]

*Pros*: Low coupling with the `Module` class. The `Module` does not need to know that there is a list of `Task` s for it.

*Cons*: It requires that the `ModuleCode` must uniquely identify the `Module`, which requires
more time to implement from the `Module` side. The association between `Module` and `Task`
is weak.

* **Alternative 2:**

Each `Module` consists of a list of `Task` s corresponding to it.

.Class Diagram: A `Module` consists of `Task` objects.
image::ModuleTaskCompositionDiagram.png[]

*Pros*: This design better simulates the real-life interactions between `Module` and `Task`.
For each NUS `Module`, we have the list of all the `Task` s for it,
such as assignments, homework, term tests, and exams.

*Cons*: Strong data coupling with the `Module` class, as the `Task` data
must be shared with the `Modules`.

Alternative 1 is chosen for more straightforward implementation, and to reduce coupling
between `Task` and `Module`.

===== Aspect: A `Task` may have a specified time, or no time. How do we implement this feature?
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**

`Task` is implemented as an abstract class. A task with a specified time will be created as a `ScheduledTask`, while a task with no
time will be created as a `NonScheduledTask`. `ScheduledTask` and
`NonScheduledTask` are concrete subclasses of `Task`.

*Pros*: Utilises Object-Oriented Programming. Commands such as  `task *search*`
(searching for tasks that occur on a specified date, month, or year)
and `task *upcoming*` (`[coming in v2.0]`, finding the upcoming tasks in our schedule)
are easier to implement. We just need to filter out the `ScheduledTask` instances and
perform operations on them.

*Cons*: More difficulty in implementation due to time constraints. For example, command
`task *edit*` allows us to add a time to a class. In this case, our `Task` is
initially a `NonScheduledTask`, so we have to re-create a new `ScheduledTask`
with the same description, and the specified time.

* **Alternative 2:**

`Task` is implemented as a concrete class. `Task` s without a specified time
will have  `taskDateTime` set to `null`, while `Task` s with a given time will be assign
a valid `taskDateTime`

*Pros*: Much more simple, as we only need to create one class `Task`.

*Cons*: It's troublesome to implement `*task* search` and `*task* upcoming` command
as above, as we have to avoid `null` cases of `taskDateTime`. Just imagine
comparing a task with a valid time, such as `13/4/2020 23:59`, to a task with time `null`.
It's hard to implement this comparison.

Alternative 1 is chosen because it works well with all of our `Task` commands,
such as `*task* search` and `*task* upcoming` above.

=== Facilitator Management Feature

// tag::facilitator[]
The facilitator feature manages the facilitators in Mod Manager and is represented by the `Facilitator` class.
A facilitator has a `Name`, an optional `Phone`, an optional `Email`, an optional `Office` and one or more `ModuleCode`.

// tag::design-consideration-facilitator[]
==== Design Considerations (Zi Xin)

===== Aspect: Mutability of `Facilitator` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new facilitator with the edited fields and replace the existing facilitator with the new facilitator.
** Pros: Preserves immutability of the `Facilitator` object.
** Cons: Overhead in creating a new `Facilitator` object for every edit operation.
* **Alternative 2:** Modify the existing facilitator directly.
** Pros: More convenient and lower overhead to edit a facilitator by setting the relevant fields without creating a new `Facilitator` object.
** Cons: Unintentional modification of the `Facilitator` object.

Alternative 1 is chosen to preserve the immutability of the Facilitator object to avoid unintentional modification.

===== Aspect: Storage of facilitators
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store all facilitators in a single facilitator list.
** Pros: Will not have to maintain multiple lists. Less memory usage as each facilitator is represented once. Will not have to iterate through multiple lists to find all instances of a particular facilitator when executing facilitator commands.
** Cons: Have to iterate through the whole list to find facilitators for a particular module when executing module commands.
* **Alternative 2:** Store facilitators for each module in a separate list.
** Pros: Able to find facilitators for a particular module easily when executing module commands.
** Cons: May contain duplicates as some facilitators may have multiple module codes. Have to iterate through multiple lists when executing facilitator commands.

Alternative 1 is chosen as the design is simpler without the need to maintain multiple lists and can also avoid duplicates in the storage.

===== Aspect: Reference of `ModuleCode` in `Facilitator` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `ModuleCode` object for each `Facilitator`.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Existence of multiple identical `ModuleCode` objects.
* **Alternative 2:** Reference each `Facilitator` to the `ModuleCode` in the `Module` list.
** Pros: Only require one `ModuleCode` object per unique `ModuleCode`. Can support editing of module codes more easily.
** Cons: Have to iterate through the module list to find the module code for the facilitator.

Alternative 1 is chosen because of ease of implementation due to time constraint.

//tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar Feature
The calendar feature manages the calendar in Mod Manager and is represented by the Calendar class. A calendar has a LocalDate.

It supports the following operations:

* `view` - Views the schedules and tasks in a whole week in Mod Manager.
* `find` - Finds empty slots in a week from current day to end of the week in Mod Manager.

==== Implementation Details

===== Viewing the calendar (Lu Shing)
The view calendar feature allows users to view the calendar for a week in Mod Manager.
This feature is facilitated by `CalCommandParser`, `CalViewCommandParser` and `CalViewCommand`. The calendar is exposed in the `Model` interface in `Module#updateCalendar()` and it is retrieved in `MainWindow` to show the timeline for the specified week to users.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar view mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the calendar view command and provides which week to be viewed. The week to be viewed can be this or next week.
2. `CalViewCommandParser` creates a new `Calendar` based on the specified week.
3. `CalViewCommandParser` creates a new `CalViewCommand` based on the `Calendar`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `CalViewCommand`.
5. `ModelManager` updates the calendar in `ModelManager`.
6. `MainWindow` retrieves the calendar from `LogicManager` which retrieves from `ModelManager`.
7. `MainWindow` shows the calendar.

The following sequence diagram shows how the calendar view command works:

.Sequence Diagram for `cal view` Command

NOTE: The lifeline for `CalCommandParser`, `CalViewCommandParser` and `CalViewCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a calendar view command:

===== Finding empty slots in calendar (Lu Shing)
The find empty in calendar feature allows users to know the empty slots they have in the calendar from the current day to the end of the week in Mod Manager. This feature is facilitated by `CalCommandParser`, `CalFindCommandParser` and `CalFindCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the calendar find mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user executes the calendar find command.
2. `CalFindCommandParser` creates a new `CalFindCommand`.
3. `LogicManager` executes the `CalFindCommand`.
//end::calendar[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a calendar find command:

.Activity Diagram for `cal find` Command
image::CalFindActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations (Lu Shing)

===== Aspect: Calendar appearance
.New Design for Calendar Appearance (Alternative 1)
image::NewCalendar.png[width="800"]


.Old Design for Calendar Appearance (Alternative 2)
image::OldCalendar.png[width="800"]

//tag::cal-design[]
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Displaying the days of a week in calendar from left to right.
** Pros: The whole week can be seen on one screen without having users to scroll down for a particular day.
** Cons: Words that are long in number of characters may not be able to be displayed in a single line.
* **Alternative 2:** Displaying the days of a week in the calendar from top to bottom.
** Pros: Tasks and schedules that have description that are long can be displayed in a single line.
** Cons: There is a need for users to scroll down to see a particular day.
If there are many tasks and schedules in a day, the other days after it will be pushed downwards and this requires even more scrolling for users.

Alternative 1 is chosen as it is better that people are able to see their whole schedules and tasks for a week in one look.
It makes better use of space than alternative 2 where the right side is usually not used.

===== Aspect: Command syntax for calendar find command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User is required to input `cal find empty`.
** Pros: It is short in command length.
** Cons: Since there is only one type of calendar find, `empty` may seem redundant.
* **Alternative 2:** User is required to input `cal find /type empty`.
** Pros: With the need to input `/type`, it can be clear about the type of find the command is trying to do.
This is because without the `/type`, it is possible that users thought that the command is finding the word `empty`.
** Cons: It can be tedious for users to type `/type` and this increases the command length.

Alternative 1 is chosen because it is shorter than alternative 2 and hence it can be easier for users to type.
It is easier to implement too. The word `empty` is kept to allow users to know what the find command is for.
//end::cal-design[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
