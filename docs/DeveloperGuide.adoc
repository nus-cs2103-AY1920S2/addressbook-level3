== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `moduleAdd m/CS2103T`.

// tag::UIDiagram[]
.Component interactions for `moduleAdd m/CS2103T` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component


.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="790"]
// end::UIDiagram[]


*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CalendarListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[width="790"]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Part of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Module Search

image::SearchCommandUMLDiagram.png[width="790"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/searcher/Search.java[`Search.java`]

Module Search function returns `module` object that contains useful information for each module for the rest of the application to use.
The function first checks if the information is available in local cache, and if it isnt, pulls it from NUSmods API.
The JSON object pulled from the web is then parsed into a `module` object.
This implementation means that a local cache of the added modules will be available even if the user is offline.


// tag::ModuleBook[]
=== Profile (Module Book) feature (Wangkai)

This profile feature allows users to manage the modules they have taken before or is taking now in NUS.
In details, users are able to store their module taken into the program with the grades for each module stated if applicable and
can also store tasks which are related to each module.

==== Implementation
- This feature is implemented using a panel on the main screen of profile tab with a list of modules that is updated with every command that
may affect module list (such as add, delete or grade).

- The module book (profile) currently supports following features.

. Adds in or deletes modules and display the list of modules in profile tab.
. Updates user's grades for each module and get CAP calculated immediately.
. Manage the tasks related to each module (module tasks) through CLI.
. Any modification to module tasks will be updated in the Calendar tab and also show messages on the result display panel.

.Class diagram of structure and relations of NusModule, ModuleBook and relevant classes.
image::NusModuleClassDiagram.png[width="790"]

- As shown in the class diagram above, modules are created by a class called `NusModule`. Every instance of `NusModule` contains a `ModuleCode` object, a
`Grade` object (optional) and a list of `ModuleTask` objects.

- `Grade` and `Priority` are enumerations. `Grade` contains all possible grades student can get in NUS. Every `ModuleTask` instance has a `Priority` attribute which indicates how important it is.

[NOTE]
The module book only accept modules that are provided in NUS and will check the module code the user want to add is valid or not by using the search feature mentioned above.

- All possible actions mentioned above such as creating modules, deleting modules and adding tasks to modules are implemented through
the `ModuleBook` class by calling corresponding methods of it such as `addModule`, `getModule`.

- The program will automatically save any modification to module book after each command is executed by calling the `saveModuleBook` method
in `Storage`.

- For example, modules are created with `moduleAdd` command, followed by the module code and grade. (if applicable) +
Our program will check if the module code is valid by using the search feature above and whether the module has already been added in our module book.
And then call method `addModule` in `ModuleBook` to create the module as required. Finally, it will automatically save the module added just now.

- The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user want to add a module in our program.


.Sequence diagram when moduleAdd command is executed
image::ModuleAddSequenceDiagram.png[width="950"]

.Relation between ModuleBook and Task
image::PartOfModelClassDiagramForProfile.png[width="400"]

- The program will synchronize the modification to module tasks in `ModuleBook` with that shown in Calendar tab through `ModelManager` as shown above.
i.e. Any modification in module tasks will be updated in `Task` which is the main class Calendar feature depends on. (see more details in Calendar feature)

==== Example Use Scenario

Given below are example usages scenario and how the Module Book feature behaves at each step.

[TIP]
User can manage their tasks in different ways.

*Example 1*: +

. The user execute `listModuleTasks` command.
. The program check whether the module code provided has been recorded or not.
. Display the list of tasks.

Below is an activity diagram describing the events that will happen:

.Activity diagram for list module tasks command
image::ListModuleTasksActivityDiagram.png[width="790"]

*Example 2*: +

. The user execute `done` command.
. The program check whether the input is valid or not.
. The task specified will be deleted accordingly.
. Synchronize between module book and calendar.

Below is an activity diagram describing the events that will happen:

.Activity diagram for done command
image::DoneCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="850"]

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect 1*: How the user add in a module into module book for future management ?

- *Current solution*: Only need to provide the module code to add module and it will fetch the information about the module using Module Search feature automatically.
* *Pros*: Users don't need to provide any other information (such as modular credit of the module) for other functionality such as calculating the CAP.
* *Pros*: The module information will be cached locally after you add the module once and this can used for future development.
* *Cons*: Need Internet connection when you add in certain module for the first time.
* *Cons*: Highly depends on the Module Search feature.

- *Alternative Solution*: Let the user enter all information required for each module when they add it in. (such as modular credit)
* *Pros*: More flexible, not depends on other features.
* *Cons*: Very tedious for users to add in lots of modules.
* *Cons*: Need to ask user to provide new information when more new functionality is added in the future.

*Reason for chosen implementation*: +
The current implementation is much more user friendly and have more potential for future development. The implement can become
very ideal if the Module Search feature works properly.

*Aspect 2*: How the user manage their tasks for each module?

- *Current solution*: For each module added, it contains a list of `ModuleTask`. Also update the calendar when add task in.
* *Pros*: Users can either view their tasks for each module separately or view all the tasks shown in Calendar tab.
* *Pros*: More nice-looking that the user can view all the deadlines on calendar.
* *Cons*: Prone to bugs during the synchronization of module book and calendar.

- *Alternative solution*: Only store the list of `ModuleTask` in module book and do not update in Calendar tab.
* *Pros*: Easier to implement and can avoid some synchronization bugs.
* *Cons*: Users can not gain a view of the whole pictures with all tasks shown on calendar.

*Reason for chosen implementation*: +
The current implementation updates the module tasks added in onto the calender and provides the users different ways
to manage their tasks. (as a whole or separately for each module)
// end::ModuleBook[]

// tag::Xinwei[]
=== Calendar Feature (Xinwei)
NUSProductivity consist of a calendar feature that provides an overarching view of all tasks, allowing user to view their uncompleted tasks and whether there is a task present on the date itself.

The calendar feature allows users to add either a `deadline` or a `Module Task` to the calendar, which inherits from a super class `Task`


==== Implementation


The implementation of the main Calender tab is facilitated a `SplitPane` in the MainWindow class consisting of 2 main classes, `CalenderListPanel` and `CalenderPanel`

The `CalenderListPanel` on the right contains a list of `Task` added to the calendar will the `CalenderPanel` shows the actual calender view for the current month.

The diagram below describes the class structure of the calendar class structure.

.Calender UI Class Diagram
image::CalenderUIClassDiagram.png[]

Upon initialisation of CalenderPanel, the CalenderPanel would call its 2 methods of `setMonth()` and `setDate()` to create `CalenderDate` instances starting from the first day of the current month.

Then, upon initialisation of CalenderListPanel, it will create instances of `CalenderDeadline` by getting the `ObservableList<Task>` from `getDeadlineTaskList`.

This will call upon the inner class in `CalenderListPanel`, `DeadlineListViewCell updateItem` method which allows the program to check whether there is any deadline due on any on the date in `calenderDatesArrayList`.

If a `deadline` or a `Module Task` is found, `setPriorityColour()` and `setStatusColour()` will be invoked to update the Calendar display to change the colour of the dots based on the priority levels mentioned in the User Guide.

Every time a `Task` is modified, the `DeadlineListViewCell updateItem` method will be invoked to update any changes to the display.

==== Implementation logic

* Implementation: both deadline and module Task are inherits from the super class Task. A task is created when the `moduleTask` or `deadlineAdd` command is invoked.

* The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user wants to add a task to the program.

.Add task sequence diagram
image::AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `addDeadlineTask` method will modify the `ObservableList<Task>` supplied to the `CalenderListPanel`, invoking the `updateItem` method, causing a change in the user display.

All other calendar functions works similarly to `addDeadlineTask` as shown in the Activity diagram below.

.Calendar Activity Diagram
image::CalendarActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations:

Aspect 1: Method of displaying the dot indicator

* *Current solution*: Currently, the dot is being shown by getting the `static HashMap` from `Task` as this `HashMap` stores a key-pair value of date - Tasks.
* By making changes to the `deadlineTaskList`, we also edited the `HashMap`. This allows everytime a `updateItem` method call to check whether a task is present, and if so the priority of the task.

* *Alternative 1*: Store all tasks of the current date in `CalendarDate`.
** Pros: Allows for tasks to be accessed locally and not through a static variable from the main class `Task`.
** Cons: Implementation may be more complex as more parameters have to be passed to `CalenderDate` and also ensuring that the list of task passed in `CalendarDate` is up to date.


**Reason for chosen implementation:**
The current solution is easier to implement as everything is done in the relevant functions such as `deadlineAdd` or `taskDelete`. The only thing that the program needs to check is whether a date in the `HashMap` contains a task and if so, the priority of the task. With the alternative implementation, we will need to pass in a `List` for each of the 31 dates which may be very troublesome to keep track of especially when we are editing the main task list. This ease of implementation is the deciding factor when choosing which method to implement.




=== Notes Feature (Xinwei)

==== Implementation

The notes feature allow users to access their desktop files and folders with commands.

This feature is implemented using a panel on the main window, listing out a list of documents and folders that are in the specified directory.

Notes features includes `notesOpen`, `notesCreate`, `notesDelete` and `notesList`.

The diagram below shows the sequence diagram of a `notesOpen` command with the other methods working similarly to the stated method.

.Notes Open Sequence Diagram
image::notesOpenSequenceDiagram.png[width="600"]



.Notes List Activity Diagram
image::NotesList.png[width="600"]

.Notes Open Activity Diagram
image::NotesCreation.png[width="600"]

notesCreate and notesDelete activity diagram works similar to notesOpen.


==== Pathing
Our program allows the user to specify different pathing system, namely:

   1. AbsolutePath
   2. RelativePath

.Notes Pathing Diagram
image::absVSrel.png[width="600"]

AbsolutePath will take the path given from `usr/`.

RelativePath will take reference from the path that the current system has opened, in this case, `usr/Desktop/NUS Y2S2`.
The user is given the freedom to provide any of the 2 forms when using the `notesOpen`, `notesCreate`, `notesDelete` and `notesList` commands.

**AbsolutePath**:

*Benefits*:

This allows for more flexibility as the user do not need to keep note of its current directory and will be able to access any folder/document that is on their system

*cons*:

Will require much more input from the user, for example, referring to the above figure,
Accessing the CS2103T file requires the user to input `loc/Desktop/NUS Y2S2/CS2103T` as opposed to `loc/CS2103T` if the user is using absolute over relative pathing

**RelativePath**:

*Benefits*:

Easier for the user to navigate through the current folder and not key in the whole folder path

*Cons*:

Not as flexible. Referring to the above diagram,
Accessing the *Documents* folder will require the user to input `loc/../../Documents`, this may not be as intuitive to people with no programming background.
Using `loc/Documents abs/abs` will allow the user to access any folder from anywhere.

// end::Xinwei[]

=== Diary feature (Jiangwei)
The diary feature is just like a real life diary book. It allows you jot down any thoughts, be it for your personal life or for school work. You can also note down a concept you don't understand or your reflection for each day in case you want to revisit them in the future.
In details, users can add and delete a diary entry, display a particular diary entry and tag each entry with mood or the weather on that day.

==== Implementation
- This feature is implemented using a panel on the main screen of diary tab. The list of diary entries will update upon executing diary commands that may affect Diary Book. (such as diaryAdd, diaryDelete or diaryMood) The GUI aspect is not fully implemented yet (coming in v2.0), so the current implementation's response is in CLI style.
- The Diary Book currently supports the following features:
. Adding a diary entry
. Deleting a diary entry
. Showing the log of recorded entries
. Display a particular diary entry with specified entry ID
. Finds the list of diary entries the match a given date
. tagging a entry with mood or weather

.Class diagram of structure and relations of DiaryBook, DiaryEntry and relevant classes.
image::DiaryClass.png[width="790"]

- As shown in the class diagram above, diary entries are created by `DiaryEntry` class. Every instance of `DiaryEntry` contains a `LocalDate`, a `Mood` object (optional) and a `Weather` object (optional).
- Different types of `Mood` such as `CalmMood`, `HappyMood` extends from the abstract class `Mood`. Similar subtype relation holds for different types of weather and the abstract class `Weather`.
- List of diary entries are managed by the `DiaryBook` class. All relevant actions such as adding, deleting as described above are implemented inside `DiaryBook`. This can be seen from the methods of `DiaryBook` in the class diagram above.

==== Example Use Case
Given below are example usages scenario and how the Module Book feature behaves at each step.

- *Example*: deleting the diary entry with entry ID 1
The sequence diagram below shows how the `diaryDelete id/1` command is executed

.Sequence Diagram for executing `diaryDelete id/1`
image::DiarySequence.png[width="790"]

==== Design Considerations
How does the user edit a diary entry?
- Current solution: `Mood` and `Weather` can be updated easily with the `diaryMood` and `diaryWeather` command. However, We have not include a edit feature for the entry content. The users can first delete the entry and re-add the entry with updated diary entry.
** *Pros*: May deter users from changing past diary content as diary is meant to record what have happened and editing the past experience may not be encouraged.
** *Cons*: The users may need to retype the whole entry content which is a time consuming process.

- Alternative solution: include a feature that replaces a certain keyword with a new keyword.
** *Pros*: Requires less typing and less time consuming.
** *Cons*: May cause some unintended changes to the entry content because of entry content containing substrings of the replaced keyword.

*Reason for chosen implementation:*
We want to adhere to the fact that past diary entries should not be changed but still allows editing, only that it will require more effort. The alternative solution is certainly feasible, to avoid the downsides of the alternative solution we can incorporate regular expressions to ensure more accurate replacing. However, this may require the users to have some prior knowledge which is not desired.

=== Event Feature (Proposed) (Xuan Xin)

This feature (in the works already) is meant to be an enhancement towards the Calendar feature.

==== Implementation

* The event feature would support the following features:
** Adds and deletes events onto the calendar
** Sort events by date (default)
** Consolidate and list all events

The sequence diagram below shows how components interact with each other when user inputs `eventAdd` to add an event onto the calendar.

.Add Event Sequence Diagram
image::AddEventSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `eventAdd` method works similar to the `addDeadlineTask` above and will modify the `ObservableList<Task>` supplied to the `CalenderListPanel`, invoking the `updateItem` method, causing a change in the user display.

==== Example Use Scenario

*Example 1*: +

. The user execute `listEvent` command.
. The program checks if input is valid.
. The list of events will be displayed.

Below then shows an example of an activity diagram for the `listEvent` command.

.List Event Activity Diagram
image::ListEventActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Further Developments
 * The event feature will aim to link contacts from the addressbook to the calendar.

For now, the full activity diagram for `Event`, which has a similar implementation to `Deadline`, is shown below:

.Event Activity Diagram
image::EventActivityDiagram.png[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
