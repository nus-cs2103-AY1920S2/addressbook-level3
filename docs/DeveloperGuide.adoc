== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[NOTE]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-s 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete-s 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SupplierListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InventoryManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a supplier).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("buy g/Apple q/50")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `buy g/Apple q/50` Command
image::BuySequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `BuyCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores three sets of versioned data: `VersionedAddressBook`, `VersionedInventory` and `VersionedTransactionHistory`,
which inherit features from their non-versioned counterparts
* exposes three unmodifiable lists: `ObservableList<Supplier>`, `ObservableList<Good>` and `ObservableList<Transaction>`
to be observed and displayed by the UI.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `AddressBook` stores a list of `Supplier` objects, which each:

* stores details of a supplier: `Name`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Email` and `Offer`.
* can have variable number of `Offer` objects, representing an offer to sell a specific good at a specific price.
* links to a `GoodName` and a `Price` via each of its `Offer` objects

.Structure of the AddressBook
image::SupplierModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `Inventory` stores a list of `Good` objects, which each stores details of a good:

* its name `GoodName`,
* two quantities represented by two `GoodQuantity` objects, one indicating the current quantity and the other the
minimum threshold quantity

.Structure of the Inventory
image::GoodModelClassDiagram.png[]

The `TransactionHistory` stores a list of `Transaction` objects. Each `Transaction` stores common details of a transaction:

* `TransactionId` for unique identification,
* `GoodName` for the transaction good, and
* `GoodQuantity` for the transaction quantity.

A `Transaction` can be either `SellTransaction` or `BuyTransaction`:

* `SellTransaction` has a `Price` to indicate the price at which the goods is sold.
* `BuyTransaction` has a `Supplier` and a `Price` to indicate the supplier and the price the goods is bought at respectively.

.Structure of the TransactionHistory
image::TransactionModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save 3 sets of data: `AddressBook`, `Inventory` and `TransactionHistory` in json format, save them in separate json file and read the data back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features
are implemented and pitfalls to avoid when making modifications.

//tag::buyandsellcommand[]

=== Buy and Sell Commands

The `buy` and `sell` commands are the main ways a user is expected to
interact with the Inventory Manager, and encompasses the bulk of the commands a
user is going to enter into Inventory Manager.

==== Commonalities in Implementation of `buy` and `sell`


Both `buy` and `sell` commands are required to accomplish 3 things:

. Update the quantity in the inventory, subject to their respective validity
checks.
. Create a transaction record of itself to be added to the transaction history.
. Commit the mutated model to facilitate proper functioning of `undo` and `redo`
commands

The API that `Model` exposes has been structured to mirror the requirements
of the commands. The above 3 requirements can be satisfied by calls to:

. `Model#setGood()`
. `Model#addTransaction()`
. `Model#commit()`.

==== Specifics of `buy` Command
The two ways `buy` executes successfully depends on whether the good
already exists in the inventory or not.

* If the good does not already exist, then a new Good
entry has to be created with the quantity bought.

* If it does exist, then the
existing good entry has to be retrieved, and the quantity updated.

[CAUTION]
Developers modifying existing `Good` related information must be aware that
Goods are immutable. In updating only the `quantity` field, all other fields
must be correctly duplicated to the updated `Good` entry created. Common mistakes
are to omit those fields, resulting in loss of persistent Good related
information. To make explicit this requirement to future Developers, multiple
constructors have been created with their respective purposes documented:
`Good()`, `Good.newGoodEntry()`, `Good.goodWithName()`.


===== Buy Command Input Constraints
The following constraints have been put on `buy` command inputs. Their reasons
are discussed in the following section. Users will not be allowed to:

. Purchase from a supplier that is not in the supplier list
. Purchase a good that the supplier does not offer.
. Purchase a quantity of good that would cause the total quantity of any
individual good in the inventory to exceed the `Good` limit.

[NOTE]
The maximum `Good` limit is 999,999.

Developers seeking to modify the `buy` command must respect
the above 3 input validations as they form the basis of future features.

[NOTE]
The `buy` command format is: `buy SUPPLIER_DISPLAYED_INDEX g/GOODNAME q/QUANTITY`

The current implementation of `buy` performs validation of the above
respectively as follows:

. The `SUPPLIER_DISPLAYED_INDEX` must be within the length of list of suppliers
returned by `Model#getFilteredSupplierList()`.
. Get the offers of the supplier through `Supplier#getOffers()`.
Iterate through the `Set<Offer>` of the selected supplier to find
existence of an `Offer` with `GOODNAME`.
. Reuse the inbuilt quantity validation in the `Good` constructor to test
if the resulting inventory quantity is valid. A `Good` with the new quantity
is constructed. If the quantity is invalid, an error is thrown and the
relevant feedback to the user returned.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Format of `buy` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `buy SUPPLIER_DISPLAYED_INDEX g/GOODNAME
                                       q/QUANTITY`.
** Pros:
*** Users would not have to type out the entire Supplier's name in full and
case sensitive. This increases command input speed and further optimizes usage
for fast typists. Wasted time from typos in minimized.
*** Verification that a supplier exists in the supplier list is trivial. The
supplier at the given index only needs to be retrieved.

** Cons:
*** We lose the flexibility of having input parameters being unordered.
All inputs with a prefix flag, e.g. `g/`, can be input in any order, but now
the ``SUPPLIER_DISPLAYED_INDEX`` has to be the first parameter.
*** Additional cognitive burden on users to remember the `buy` command format's
first parameter.


* **Alternative 2:** `buy n/SUPPLIER_NAME g/GOODNAME q/QUANTITY`.
** Pros: Flexibility of having unordered input is maintained.
** Cons: Testing revealed that command entry was tedious and error prone,
especially since supplier names tended to be long and a mix of upper- and lower-
case alphabets, reducing user-friendliness.

===== Aspect: `buy` Input Constraints:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Supplier has to exist in supplier list
before purchase.

** Pros:
*** Supports future data analytics commands. We can save all relevant
transaction information with every particular supplier at the point of
transaction because the supplier will have to exist in the supplier list.
The feasible future features include: cost analysis and
ranking of suppliers by certain parameters.
*** Users do not have to enter an additional parameter: purchase price,
since this can be extracted from the Supplier's offer under the hood.

** Cons: If user has making a new purchase, he or she has to first perform data entry
for the supplier and all it's relevant information before the `buy` command
can be executed.

* **Alternative 2:** Supplier would be an optional parameter to the buy command.

** Pros: Command usage is more fluid and user-friendly.

** Cons: Cost and supplier related data would be incomplete, reducing
comprehensiveness of data analytics commands.


==== Specifics of `sell` Command

===== Sell Command Input Constraints
The following constraints have been put on `sell` command inputs. Their reasons
are discussed in the following section. Users will not be allowed to:

. Sell a good they do not currently have in inventory.
. Sell a quantity a larger quantity of a good than they currently
have in inventory.

[NOTE]
The minimum `Good` limit is 0.

Developers seeking to modify the `sell` command must respect
the above 2 input validations as they form the basis of future features.

[NOTE]
The `sell` command format is: `sell GOOD_DISPLAYED_INDEX p/PRICE q/QUANTITY`

The current implementation of `sell` performs validation as follows:

. The `GOOD_DISPLAYED_INDEX` must be within the length of list of Goods
returned by `Model#getFilteredGoodList()`.
. Reuse the inbuilt quantity validation in the `Good` constructor to test
if the resulting inventory quantity is valid. A `Good` with the new quantity
is constructed. If the quantity is invalid, an error is thrown and the
relevant feedback to the user returned.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Format of `sell` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `sell GOOD_DISPLAYED_INDEX p/PRICE
                                       q/QUANTITY`.
** Pros:
*** Users would not have to type out the entire Good's name in full and
case sensitive. This increases command input speed and further optimizes usage
for fast typists. Wasted time from typos in minimized.
*** Verification that a good exists in the inventory is trivial. The
good at the given index only needs to be retrieved.

** Cons:
*** We lose the flexibility of having input parameters being unordered.
All inputs with a prefix flag, e.g. `g/`, can be input in any order, but now
the ``GOOD_DISPLAYED_INDEX`` has to be the first parameter.
*** Additional cognitive burden on users to remember the `sell` command format's
first parameter.


* **Alternative 2:** `sell g/GOOD_NAME p/PRICE q/QUANTITY`.
** Pros: Flexibility of having unordered input is maintained.
** Cons: Testing revealed that command entry was tedious and error prone,
especially since Good names tended to be long and a mix of upper- and lower-
case alphabets, reducing user-friendliness.

//end::buyandsellcommand[]

// tag::undoredo[]

=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by three versioned databases `VersionedInventory`, `VersionedAddressBook` and `VersionedTransactionHistory`
for `Good`, `Supplier` and `Transaction` data respectively. These versioned classes extend their non-versioned
counterparts. These classes also implement the `Versionable` interface, which has these methods:

* `Versionable#commit()` -- Adds the current state to the tracked states.
* `Versionable#undo()` -- Restores the previous database state.
* `Versionable#redo()` -- Restores the most recently undone database state.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface, which extends `Versionable` as well.
Each call of these methods will call the respective methods of each of the versioned classes.

The class diagram below shows how the classes are related to each other.

image::VersionClassDiagram.png[]

The three versioned classes use the same logic for versioning, so only `VersionedInventory` will be mentioned in
subsequent examples and diagrams.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the events that occur when a user calls the undo command assuming that there is
a state to return to. `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` and `VersionedTransactionHistory#undo()` are called as well, but
omitted for brevity.

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

Currently, `VersionedInventory` uses `LinearHistory<Inventory>` for versioning, and delegates all `Versionable` methods
to it. `LinearHistory<Inventory>` stores Inventory, which has implemented the `Copyable<Inventory>` interface to allow
creation of independent copies for storage. On the other hand, `LinearHistory` implements the interface
`Version<Inventory>`, which extends from `Versionable` and has the following additional method:

* `Version#getCurrentState()` -- Returns the current state of the stored object

The class diagram below shows how the classes are connected such that `VersionedInventory` is able to use
`LinearHistory<Inventory>`.

image::LinearHistoryClassDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the
lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.
For simplicity, goods are each represented with strings containing their name and quantity.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInventory` will be created with a list
of `Good` objects from storage, while creating a `LinearHistory<Inventory>` that stores a copy of this state,
and also stores another copy in its history. Using `copy()` method from `Copyable<Inventory>` ensures
`currentState` and `saved0` are independent `Inventory` objects.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete-g 3` command to delete the 3rd good in the inventory list. The `delete-g` command
first deletes the 3rd good in the `currentState` of the `LinearHistory<Inventory>`, exposed by `VersionedInventory`.
Then, the command calls `Model#commit()` since it modifies the data. `LinearHistory<Inventory>` then
makes a copy of the modified `currentState` and stores it in the history, moving the statePointer up.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `buy 1 g/apple q/5` to buy 5 apples from the first supplier. Let us assume that the first
supplier sells apples. The `buy` command also calls `Model#commit()` as it modifies the data,
causing `LinearHistory<Inventory>` to save a copy of the modified `currentState`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commit()`, so the `currentState` will not be saved
into the history.

Step 4. The user now decides that buying the apples was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `statePointer` one step backward,
pointing it to the previous saved state `saved1`, and updates `currentState` with `saved1`.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is pointing to the first state `saved0`, then there is no state to return to.
In this case, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` one step forward,
pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the `currentState` to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is pointing to the latest state, then there are no states to go to.
Thus, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list-g`. Commands that do not modify the data, such as `list-g`,
will not call `Model#commit()`. Thus, the history and `currentState` in `LinearHistory<Inventory>` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `sell g/banana q/1 p/5` to sell 1 banana, which calls `Model#commit()`.
Since there is a branching in history, all states after the state pointed by `statePointer` will be purged.
Many mainstream editing software exhibit this behaviour, which would condition the user to expect this
behavior.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire state of the database.
** Pros: Trivial implementation.
** Cons: May encounter performance issues due to memory load, especially with three different databases.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-s`, just save the supplier being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: When to save history

* **Alternative 1 (current choice) :** Save all three databases even when only one database is modified.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Inefficient memory usage, especially when only one database is being modified in each action.
* **Alternative 2:** Save a database only when that database is modified.
** Pros: Saves memory usage that could be used for performance.
** Cons: Requires information on which databases are affected by a command, which breaks abstraction on both the
versioned databases and commands.

===== Aspect: How storage of states is implemented

* **Alternative 1 (current choice) :** Store states as objects during Java runtime
** Pros: Simple implementation and automatic cleanup.
** Cons: Segmentation fault may occur for very long sessions and large databases.
* **Alternative 2:** Store states in an external file
** Pros: Less memory usage, leading to better performance.
** Cons: File I/O may incur comparable overhead, and abrupt termination of the application may
result in temporary files being left behind and cluttering space.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption
==== Proposed Implementation
The data encryption adn decryption mechanism is facilitated by `FileCryptoUtil`. The crypto algorithm employed is Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) under symmetric encryption algorithm, where both the encryption and decryption uses same key.

`FileCryptoUtil` will implement the following operations:
`FileCryptoUtil#encryptFile()` -- encrypts human readable Json file into unreadable encrypted file.
`FileCryptoUtil#decryptFile()` -- decrypts unreadable file back to readable json file.

These methods are public static and are exposed to all for now.

Given below is an example on how the encryption and decryption behave at each step.

** *Encryption*:

Whenever the user enters a valid command, under the `LogicManager#execute()`, the data is firstly convert to JsonAdaptedObject and stored in a Json file.
Next, `FileCryptoUtil#encryption()` is called. A cipher will be initiated based on the specific SecretKey,
 the algorithm used for encryption, and the transformation of the data.
The data in the json file will be read by bit and encrypted to unreadable format. The encrypted data is then stored in the encrypted file.

[NOTE]
If the command cannot be executed successfully in `LogicManager#execute()`, then exception will be thrown before `FileCryptoUtil#encryption()`,
 and the encryption will not be activated.

** *Decryption* :

When the user launches the application. `FileCryptoUtil#decryption()` will be called before the reading Json file into `StorageManager`.
A cipher will be initiated based on same SecretKey, algorithm and transformation used in the encryption of the data.
The data in the encrypted file is then read by bit and decrypted by the cipher into readable Json format.
The readable Json data is then stored in the Json file, which can be read by `JsonUtil#readJsonFile()` to JsonAdaptedObject.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Key management for cipher

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set a default key within the application.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Key cannot be changed, expose to possible brute force attack.
* **Alternative 2:** Set password requirement for the application and use password use the key.
** Pros: User can change the key regularly, which strengthen data security.
** Cons: Hard to implement to password feature. The password has to be further strengthen by PBKDF2 to enhance the complexity of the key.

// end::dataencryption[]

//tag::autoexpiry[]

=== [Proposed] Automatic Batch Expiry and Warning

The primary aim of inventory management is to ensure that there is always
sufficient stock of goods. Out-of-stock situations
cost the company needless revenue losses.

When stores sell fast moving consumer goods with short shelf lives,
this problem becomes hard to solve when every individual batch of purchases
have their respective expiry dates.

This feature aims to augment every `buy` command with it's respective
`EXPIRY_DATE`. When the expiry date approaches, unsold goods from that batch
would automatically be removed from the inventory, the user would be notified
of the expiration and warned if that causes the good to fall below it's
stipulated threshold. The command to source for suppliers who sell that good can
also be triggered to facilitate restocking of that good.

==== Proposed Implementation

===== Proposed Changes to `Good` class
Inventory Manager v1.4 currently stores the name, current quantity, and
threshold quantity of every good in the inventory. An `expiryDates` field
will be added to store all distinct expiry dates, from closest to furthest, and
the number of units expiring on that date. Java's built-in `Date` class
will suffice.

image:GoodWithExpiryDate.png[]


===== Proposed Changes to `buy` Command

The `buy` command will include an expiry date for every purchase
goods. A possible format would be: `buy SUPPLIER_DISPLAYED_INDEX q/QUANTITY
g/GOOD_NAME x/EXPIRY_DATE`. This assigns the `EXPIRY_DATE` to all `QUANTITY`
units of `GOOD_NAME` bought.

The correct `Good` entry can be retrieved from the  `InventoryManager`.
If there is currently no expiry dates on `EXPIRY_DATE`, a new `Map.entry`
will be created indicating that `QUANTITY` many units will expire on
`EXPIRY_DATE`. Else, the current `Map.entry` will be updated.

===== Proposed Changes to `sell` Command

Under this implementation, the `sell` command must sell goods in a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner. When any valid `sell` command is entered,
the earliest expiry dates are removed first. This is accomplished by reducing
the values that are mapped to the earliest expiry dates.

===== Expiry Detection

Upon Inventory Manager Program startup, the `expiryDates` of all `Good` s in the
inventory is checked with the current System Date. When any expiry date is found
to be earlier than the System date, the mapped number of goods will expire
and be removed from inventory.

===== Possible Extensions
Possible extensions of usefulness are listed below:

. Make any expiry event generate it's respective transaction record in the
transaction history.
. If goods fall below their warning threshold as a result of expiry,
have a notification to the user and display the list of suppliers that
sell that particular good, sorted by increasing price.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data Structure for `expiryDates`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `TreeMap<Date, Integer>`
** Pros: Memory efficient.
** Cons:
*** `TreeMap` navigation is more complex than a linear data structure.
*** Updating is more complex for `sell` commands, especially if goods with
multiple expiry dates are being sold.

* **Alternative 2:** Maintain an ordered `LinkedList<Date>`.
** Pros: Simple to implement and update.
*** Buying `QUANTITY` of a good would correspond to inserting `QUANTITY` of
`EXPIRY_DATE` into the list and sorting it.
*** Selling `QUANTITY` of a good would correspond to removing the first
`QUANTITY` elements.
*** Finding all expired items can be done be traversing down the list until
the first non-expired item is found. Everything traversed has expired.

** Cons:
*** Extremely memory inefficient, especially since each `Good` can contain
up to `999,999` quantity, and there will be 1 `Date` for each good stored.

//end::autoexpiry[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
