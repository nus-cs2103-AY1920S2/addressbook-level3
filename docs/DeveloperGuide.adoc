== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::schedule[]
=== [Proposed] Schedule Visualiser
==== Proposed implementation

The schedule visualiser is facilitated by the implemented `SchoolworkTracker`. The main purpose of the `SchoolworkTracker` is to allow users to keep track of all their assignments so that they do not accidentally overlook any of them. The main components of the `SchoolworkTracker` are as shown in the following class diagram.

image::stClassDiagram.png[]

This feature enhances the basic form of the `SchoolworkTracker` by allowing a user to get a better sense of their current commitments and workload so that they can better manage their time to pursue other social events and hang out with friends. It utilises the existing `Assignments` stored in the `AssignmentList` of the `SchoolworkTracker`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `SchoolworkTracker#calExpectedWorkPerDay()` -- Calculates the expected amount of work the user has to put in each day for the next five days (based on hours) to meet all deadlines.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the schedule visualizer behaves at each stage.

 Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `SchoolworkTracker` will be initialized with the initial state, which is an empty list.

Step 2. The user executes the add assignment command [`(st)add t/CS2103 tP d/2020-03-27 12:00 e/5`] to add the following assignments to the Schoolwork Tracker.

image::stFilledList.png[]

Step 3. Today is 23 March 2020 and the user wants to see how busy he is and whether he has time to go out with his friends in the next five days while still being able to complete his assignments on time.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the schedule visualisation operation works. 

image::stOverallSequenceDiagram.png[]

image::stPart1.png[]

image::stPart2.png[]

image::stPart3.png[]

Step 4. Based on the results obtained from the schedule command, the user can then decide on how to best plan his outing with his friends.

A sample result of the schedule command is as follows:

image::stScheduleResult.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the expected work hours per day is to be calculated
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allocate hours required to complete assignment whose deadline is the next day from query date, if any. Then, allocate hours of the other assignments in such a way to ensure balance workload.
** Pros: Takes into account approaching deadlines and attempts to allocate an equal number of hours each day.
** Cons: Complicated algorithm is more prone to errors.

* **Alternative 2:** Sum the estimated hours / Number of days to deadline for all assignments.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Does not take into account approaching deadlines and may result in some days having impossibly high workload.

// end::schedule[]

// tag::get[]
=== Detailed Contact Viewer
==== Implementation

The detailed contact viewer is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature allows a user to view a particular contact details in entirety.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the get mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial state, which is an empty list.

Step 2. The user executes the `(ab)add n/David ...`  command to add a new person.

Step 3. The user executes the `(ab)get 1` command to get the detailed contact of the first person in the AddressBook list.

image::detailedContact.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the get operation works within the `Logic` component:

image::getCommand.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What information to display
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set a limit on details that has a potential long list (such as NoteTaker) and display them on the detailed contact viewer.
** Pros: All information are displayed for easier viewing/access.
** Cons: AddressBook list might be long and hard to view.
* **Alternative 2:** Display selective information on the AddressBook list and the full information under get command.
** Pros: AddressBook list is less cluttered.
** Cons: Omits certain information.

=== Sorting of Assignments
==== Implementation

The sorting of assignments is facilitated by `AssignmentList`. This feature allows a user to sort assignments by deadline or estimated completion time.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The 'AssignmentList' will be initialized with the initial state, which is an empty list.

Step 2. The user executes the following commands to add new assignments.
* 1. `(st)add t/CS2103 Project d/2020-04-18 23:59 e/180`
* 2. `(st)add t/DBA3702 Project d/2020-04-19 19:00 e/150`
* 3. `(st)add t/CS2106 Lab d/2020-04-11 20:00 e/20`

Step 3. The user executes the `(st)list -d` command to sort the assignments by deadline.

image::sortAssignment.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the list assignment operation works within the `Logic` component:

image::listAssgnCommand.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to sort assignment by estimated completion time
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Descending order
** Pros: User can prioritise by doing the assignment which takes the longer first.
** Cons: User may spend too much time on assignments that take much longer.
* **Alternative 2:** Ascending order
** Pros: User can clear more assignments faster, by completing those that takes a shorter amount of time first.
** Cons: User may delay starting on assignments that take longer and risk having uncompleted assignments at the deadline.

=== Editing of Restaurant Notes
==== Implementation

The editing of restaurant notes is facilitated by `RestaurantBook`. This feature allows a user to edit existing notes of a restaurant in the list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the editing of note mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The `RestaurantBook` will be initialized with the initial state, which is an empty list.

Step 2: The user executes the following commands to add notes to a restaurant.
* 1. `(rt)add n/Ameens l/Clementi v/No o/09:2300 p/$ c/Indian`
* 2. `(rt)addnote r/Cheese fries`

Step 3: The user executes the `(rt)editnote 1 rl/1 r/Butter chicken` command to edit the first recommended food of the restaurant at index 1, to Butter chicken.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit restaurant note operation works within the `Logic` component.

image::addRestNote.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to execute the command for edit note, given 3 editable notes for a restaurant.
* **Alternative 1 (chosen):** Have one command that allows user to choose any note to edit.
** Pros: Easy for user to use, without switching between different commands.
** Cons: As line number of the relevant note needs to be indicated, many levels of checking of the user input is required, and is thus more prone to errors.
* **Alternative 2:** Have 3 separate edit commands, one for each restaurant's note.
* Pros: Easier to implement.
* Cons: Not user-friendly since different notes cannot be edited in a single command.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
