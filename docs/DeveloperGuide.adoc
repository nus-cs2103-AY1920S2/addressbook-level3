Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletep 1`.

.Component interactions for `deletep 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width="700"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InventorySystemParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a customer).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletec 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletec 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Inventory System data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Customer>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Product>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Transaction>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Inventory System`, which `Customer` can reference. This would allow `Inventory System` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Customer` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[width="600"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Inventory System data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::manageitem[]
=== Add delete/edit/clear/list/find <<customer,customer>>/<<product,product>> feature
The manage product mechanism is facilitated by `InventorySystemParser`.
First, the InventorySystemParser class parses the user command.
This results in a Command object which is executed by the LogicManager.
The command execution modifies Model's customer list depending on the command.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The following commands are available to be parsed by InventorySystemParser:

* `AddCustomerCommand/AddProductCommand`
- Adds the customer/product into the list in the inventory system.
* `ListCustomerCommand/ListProductCommand`
- Lists all customer/product in the list.
* `ClearCustomerCommand/ClearProductCommand`
- Clears all customer/product in the list.
* `DeleteCustomerCommand/DeleteProductCommand`
- Deletes the selected customer/product from the list in the inventory system.
* `EditCustomerCommand/EditProductCommand`
- Edits the customer/product details.
* `FindCustomerCommand/FindProductCommand`
- Finds customer/product with attributes containing given keyword(s).

The commands all inherit from superclass `Command`. Only add, delete, edit and find commands require a command parser to parse the arguments entered by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

image::AddItemSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

image::ListItemSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

image::EditItemSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a command that changes the customer/product list in the model:

image::CommandActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How commands are executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Keep customers/products in the inventory system
** Pros: Easy to implement, use less memory
** Cons: If inventory system is corrupted then the data is lost
* **Alternative 2:** Keep customers/products in individual management systems, separate each of the classes
** Pros: Keep implementation of products, customers and transactions separate
** Cons: Use more memory, tedious implementation

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list (`ArrayList`) to store the customers/products
** Pros: Easy to sort and iterate through the list, get(index) method always gives an O(1) performance
** Cons: allows duplicates
* **Alternative 2:** Use a hashmap to store the customers/products
** Pros: Find can be done in O(1), does not allow duplicate keys
** Cons: Difficult to sort and iterate through hashmap, get(key) can be O(1) in the best case and O(n) in the worst case.
// end::manageitem[]

// tag::managetransaction[]
=== Add/edit/delete <<transaction,transactions>>
The user input is handled by the `MainWindow` class in Ui first, then passed to the `LogicManager` and parsed into
`AddTransactionCommand`, `EditTransactionCommand`, etc. Depending on the nature of each command, new transaction or
updated transaction will be added to a new index or existing index of the `UniqueTransactionList`, hosted by the
`InventorySystem` class. For the `deleteTransactionCommand`, a transaction will be dropped from the `internalList`.
Since the `quantity` and `sales` attribute will affect the same attributes of a product, the affiliated `product` will
also be edited. In the end, the `filteredTransactionList` of the system will be updated so that the user can view the change
accordingly. Three commands are implemented corresponding to these 3 operations in the logic module:

* `AddTransactionCommand` -- Adds a transaction into the system and update the the quantity and sales attribute
of the corresponding product.
* `EditTransactionCommand` -- Edit detials of a transaction. If `quantity` is changed, edit the affected product
as well.
* `DeleteTransactionCommand` -- Delete a transaction from the system and edit the affiliated product.

For each command, a parser is implemented to parse the input into arguments.

* `AddTransactionCommmandParser` -- Parse the add transaction input and generates `AddTransactionCommand`. +
* `EditTransactionCommandParser` -- Parse the edit transaction input and generates `EditTransactionCommand`. +
* `DeleteTransactionCommandParser` --Parse the delete transaction input and generates `DeleteTransactionCommand`. +

The following sequence diagram shows how each operation works.

AddTransaction Operation:

image::AddTransactionSequenceDiagram.png[]
NOTE: The AddTransactionCommmandParser returns a transactionFacotry with `productIndex` and `customerIndex`, while a
transaction is only generated in AddTransactionCommand.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to store product & customer in transaction.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the product/ customer instance as an attribute.
** Pros: Easy to construct a transaction and display product/ customer name.
** Cons: Easy to generate bugs while any of the instance is editted.
* **Alternative 2:** Store an unique id and name of the product/ customer.
** Pros: Do not need to update transaction while product is editted.

===== Aspect: How to change the quantity & sales attribute of product while editing transactions.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** If quantity/ product is changed,
re-store the quantity & sales of the original product, check validation
(whether the product has that much inventory as required on transaction), and then
and update the quantity & sales of the new product.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Likely to generate bugs when the new quantity exceeds inventory, i.e. the edit operation is not valid.

* **Alternative 2:** If quantity/ product is changed, check validation first,
re-store the quantity & sales of the original product, and then
and update the quantity & sales of the new product.
** Pros: Straightforward logic, not likely to create bugs.
** Cons: Validation checking would be very complex.
// end::managetransaction[]

// tag::getprofitrevenue[]
=== Get <<revenue,revenue>>/<<profit,profit>> feature
The manage product mechanism is facilitated by `InventorySystemParser`.
First, the InventorySystemParser class parses the user command.
Then the `RevenueCommandParser/ProfitCommandParser` parses the user input arguments into Command objects.
The resulting `RevenueCommand/ProfitCommand` is executed by the LogicManager.
The command execution calculates the revenue/profit depending on the command.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The following commands are available to be parsed by InventorySystemParser:

* `RevenueCommand`
- Gets the revenue made in a selected period.
* `ProfitCommand`
- Gets the profit made in a selected period.

The commands all inherit from superclass `Command` and require command parsers to parse the user input arguments.

The following sequence diagram shows how the profit operation works:

image::ProfitSequenceDiagram.png[]
The revenue operation works in the same way as the profit operation.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How commands are executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculate revenue/profit only when needed
** Pros: Decreases coupling, easy to test
** Cons: Need to keep calculating if command is frequently used (increase time complexity especially if transaction list is long)
* **Alternative 2:** Keep track of revenue/profit in a singleton class
** Pros: No need to calculate when revenue/profit command is executed (instead, revenue/profit is updated whenever a transaction is added or edited)
** Cons: Hard to unit test, increase coupling
// end::getprofitrevenue[]

//tag::lowlimitfeature[]
=== Setting low limit threshold to receive notifications for products
The low limit mechanism is facilitated by `InventorySystemParser`.
First, the InventorySystemParser class parses the user command.
Then the `LowLimitCommandParser` parses the user input arguments into `LowLimitCommand` object.
The resulting `LowLimitCommand` is executed by the LogicManager.
The command execution sets the updated threshold for the chosen product.
The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a CommandResult object which is passed back to the Ui.

The command inherit from superclass `Command` and require command parser to parse the user input arguments.

The following sequence diagram shows how the low limit operation works:

image:LowLimitCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How the threshold field is being updated.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate low limit threshold command with edit product command
** Pros: Decreases coupling, easier to test.
** Cons: Additional command to edit the field of an product.
* **Alternative 2:** Integrate with existing edit product command
** Pros: Will reduce number of commands the user needs to use.
** Cons: Hard to unit test, increase coupling.
//end::lowlimitfeature[]

//tag::notificationWindow[]
=== Notification window for products
The notification window appears whenever an product's quantity reaches the threshold that was set. +
The notification comes with information such as the product's description and remaining quantity left.

The following activity diagram shows how the operation works:

image:NotificationWindowActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Display of the notification window

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only display product's name and remaining quantity.
** Pros: User friendly, easy to implement.
** Cons: Have to find and change the product's quantity via the command line.
* **Alternative 2:** Provide quick way to change product's quantity via GUI
** Pros: Speeds up the process of stocking up.
** Cons: Hard to do testing for GUI, and project scope was on command line application.
//end::notificationWindow[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[appendix]
== Effort

Throughout this journey, we have overcame many challenges and gained much more experience in software engineering.
Our project was ambitious as it consisted of multiple entities. In addition to the original address book with the persons entity, we also included products and transactions to the system.
Since the structure was quite complex, we had to brainstorm about the best way to incorporate products and transactions into the app.

The person class had to be refactored to fit our user profile of customers.
The commands for products were similar to the original commands for person, however there were also some differences since the requirements for products and persons varied.
For example, the attributes required for products were vastly different for customers, and new restrictions needed to be applied.
The commands for transactions were quite different from both customers and products, since transaction is an association class between customer and product.
For example, the add transaction command affected the product quantity and sales, so it had to update the product too, whereas for customer and product there was no need to modify other classes.
We also needed to consider the proper way to keep track of customers and products to ensure that there were no duplicates. Initially we tried keeping track using only the attributes however there were bugs so we added customer and product ids.

With multiple entities, a lot of thought went into figuring out how to display all the data.
Throughout the process, we revamped the ui such that all the information would be presented clearly. Ultimately, our design differed from the original as we settled on a tab design.
Initially, there were different windows showing different information too. In the end, we combined most of the information into a single window, and split the information shown according to categories which were listed as tabs.
Besides the layout of the ui, the design also took time to finalise as we wanted to make our app look professional and modern.

Lastly, the statistics were quite challenging to implement. This is especially so as we used various bars and graphs, which were new to us and we had to learn independently.
The calculations were relatively easier as it was just simple math calculations of profit etc.

In all, even though our project was complex, we managed to implement most of our features and even included extra features that we had not plan on intially. Given the moderate to high difficulty level of the project, we are glad that we achieved our project goals.
