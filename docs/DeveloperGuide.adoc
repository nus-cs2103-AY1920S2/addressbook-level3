== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting a person

. Deleting a person while all persons are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
   Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
   Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) _{give more}_ +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

== Implementation

[discrete]
=== Assigning/ linking 2 entities
All assign command variants (i.e `AssignTeacherToCourseCommand`, `AssignStudentToCourseCommand` extends from `AssignCommandBase`
instead of the abstract `Command` class.

The diagram below shows a simplified flow

.Structure of Commands and Parser
image::AssignCommandImplementation.png[]

==== Design considerations:
- Since all assign commands are just linking between two entities, where each of them is distinguised based on
its ID and its entity name (e.g course, student, teacher, etc). So we have AssignDescriptor which stores this information.

- A factory design pattern to select which assign command based on the AssignDescriptor content.
