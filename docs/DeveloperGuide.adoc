=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the
App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.


`Main` has two classes called
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and
connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where
necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by
multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log
file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard
disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other
for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of three main parts -
`CommandBox`, `CalendarResultDisplayPanel` and  a `TabsPanel`.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The TabsPanel can be further divided into three tabs - `HelpPane`, `SummaryPane`
and the `CouponListPanel`. The `CouponListPanel` contains the `CouponCard` that
represents the `Coupon` s themselves.

The `CalendarResultsDisplayPanel` is split into two UI components - the
`CalendarPane` and the `ResultDisplay`. As the name suggests, the `CalendarPane`
holds the calendar that allows easy visualization of expiry dates. The
`ResultDisplay` provides feedback from Coupon Stash to the user after he runs a
command.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in
the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`]
is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the
modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `CouponStashParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a coupon).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult`
object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform
certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic`
component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker
(X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of
diagram. This limitation affects all of the sequence diagrams in this document.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Coupon Stash data.
** some examples of preferences that can be set are the money symbol, or
window sizes.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Coupon>` that can be 'observed' e.g.
the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the
data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in Coupon Stash, which a
`Coupon` can refer to.
This would allow Coupon Stash to only require one `Tag` object per unique
tag, instead of each `Coupon` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
+
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Coupon Stash data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `csdev.couponstash.commons`
package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are
implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by with an undo/redo history, stored
internally as an `couponStashStateList` with a `commandTextHistory` and
`currStateIndex`. All these components are encapsulated in the `HistoryManager`
class.
The following methods in the `Model` interface facilitates this feature:

* `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)` -- Saves the current coupon
stash state and the command text that triggered the change in state into
`HistoryManager`.
* `Model#undo()` -- Restores the previous coupon stash state from
`HistoryManager`.
* `Model#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone coupon stash state from
`HistoryManager`.

==== Current Implementation
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism
behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `CouponStash` will be initialized with the initial coupon stash state, and
the `currStateIndex` pointing to that single coupon stash state.

.`CouponStash` will be initialized with the initial coupon stash state.
image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th coupon in the
coupon stash.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`,
causing the modified state of the coupon stash after the `delete 5` command
executes to be saved in the `couponStashStateList`, and the `delete 5` command
text to be stored in the `commandTextHistory`.  `currStateIndex` is shifted to
the newly inserted coupon stash state.

.`currStateIndex` is shifted to the newly inserted coupon stash state.
image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/OMO STORE ...` to add a new coupon.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`,
causing another modified coupon stash state and command text to be saved into
the `couponStashStateList` and `commandTextHistory` respectively.

.Modified coupon stash state and command text are saved into the `couponStashStateList` and `commandTextHistory` respectively.
image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call
`Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`, so the coupon stash state and
command text will not be saved.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the coupon was a mistake, and decides
to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCouponStash()`, which will shift the
`currStateIndex` once to the left, pointing it to the previous coupon stash
state, and restores the coupon stash to that state. Plus, the command text is
returned, thus allowing for the display of the command that was undone. In this
case, the command undone is `add n/OMO STORE...`.

.`currStateIndex` shifted once to the left
image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currStateIndex` is at index 0, pointing to the initial coupon stash
state, then there are no previous coupon stash states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCouponStash()` to check if this is the
case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform
the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

.Undo operation sequence diagram.
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCouponStash()`,
which shifts the `currStateIndex` once to the right, pointing to the previously
undone state and command text, and restores the coupon stash to that state.
Finally, it returns the redone command text.

[NOTE]
If the `currStateIndex` is at index `couponStashStateList.size() - 1`, pointing
to the latest coupon stash state, then there are no undone coupon stash states
to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCouponStash()` to check if this is the
case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform
the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the coupon stash, such as `list`, will  not call
`Model#commitCouponStash()`.
Thus, the `couponStashStateList` remains unchanged.

.`couponStashStateList` remains unchanged.
image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCouponStash()`.
Since the `currStateIndex` is not pointing at the end of the
`couponStashStateList`, all coupon stash states and command text history after
the `currStateIndex` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/OMO
                                                                      STORE ...` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

.Command text history after the `currStateIndex` is purged.
image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a
new command text:

.
image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire coupon stash.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage. Plus, have to
perform deep copy of coupons when saving the coupon stash so as to prevent
unwanted mutations.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the coupon being
deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is
correct.

Alternative 1 was chosen due to its relative simplicity and extensibility.
Little to no modification needs to be made to each command that can be
undone, thus reducing chances of new bugs surfacing. Additionally, the ability
to undo operations such as `clear` will require alternative 2 to copy the
entire coupon stash too, so both alternatives will have the same memory
footprint in such a context. Finally, the real world performance impact of
copying all coupons vs copying one is not very huge. Thus, the more
extensible and simpler alternative 1 was chosen.

// end::undoredo[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar

==== Current Implementation
The Calendar component provides a visual representation of the stored coupons that are expiring over a month. It is
facilitated by `CalendarPane`, `DateCell`, `ObservableList<Coupon>` and `ObservableMonthView`.

The `CalendarPane` is the controller of the Calendar on display. Users can change the month on display to show the coupons
that expire during a specific month year by clicking on the arrows at the sides of the calendar's title or
by using the `goto` command.

Each `DateCell` represents each date of the month that is currently on display. Each `DateCell` uses the
`ObservableList<Coupon>` to keep a list of the coupon(s) that expires on each date. A `DateCell` with coupon(s) expiring
on the date are highlighted in red and a `Datecell` that represents the `system's date` is highlighted blue.

The `ObservableList<Coupon>` is the list of filtered coupons that are currently on display in the `CouponListPanel`.
They are obtained by calling the `Logic#getFilteredCouponList()` method. The list can be filtered to view all active,
archived or used coupons using the `expiring` command .

The `ObservableMonthView` is the current month & year on display in the `Calendar Pane`. It is obtained by calling
the `Logic#getMonthView()` method.

The class diagram below shows the interaction between classes that affects the Calendar:

.Overview of the class diagram representation of the Calendar.
image::CalendarClassDiagram.png[]

The sequence diagrams below show how the Calendar works:

.Sequence diagram representation of the Calendar on the startup of Coupon Stash.
image::CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Sequence diagram representation of the Set details of DateCell ref frame of Calendar (Applicable to the next two diagrams).
image::CalendarSequenceDiagram_Ref_SetDetailsOfDateCell.png[]

The two scenarios below are examples of how the Calendar mechanism behaves at
each step of each scenario.

===== Updating the Calendar with an Updated List
The Calendar updates with the current `ObservableList<Coupon>` with commands such as the `add`, `archive`, `clear`,
`delete`, `edit`, `expiring`, `find`, `list`, `redo`, `unarchive`, `undo` and `used`. The following steps describes how
this behavior is implemented.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

The Calendar displayed will render the saved coupon data, triggered by the initiation of the UiManager.

Step 2. The user executes a command that alters the `ObservableList<Coupon>` (any command listed above).

When a command alters the observable coupon list, the listener of the observable list detects the change and the
Calendar will be updated accordingly to the list by calling the `CalendarPane#fillUpCalendar()` method.

For example, the `find` command alters the observable coupon list. It calls the `FindCommand#execute(Model, String)`
method, which calls the `Model#updateFilteredCouponList(Predicate)` method. It then calls the
`FilteredList<Coupon>#setPredicate(Predicate)` method that alters the observable coupon list.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call the `FilteredList<Coupon>#setPredicate(Predicate)` method. Hence, the
observable coupon list will not be altered and the calendar will not be altered.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Calendar updates with the observable coupon list:

.Sequence diagram representation of the update of the Calendar with the Coupon List for the "find chicken" Command.
image::CalendarFindCommandSeqDiagram.png[]

===== Updating the Calendar with a Different Month View
The Calendar updates with the current `ObservableMonthView` with commands such as `goto`, `expiring` and `list` or by
clicking on the arrows at the sides of the calendar title. The following steps describes how this behavior is
implemented.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

The Calendar displayed will render the saved coupon data, triggered by the initiation of the UiManager. The default
calendar display will be set to the `system's month year`.

Step 2. The user executes a command that alters the `ObservableMonthView` (any command listed above).

When a command alters the observable month view, the listener of the observable month view detects the change and the
month view display of the calendar will be updated according by calling the `CalendarPane#updateCalendarWithYearMonth`
method.

For example, the `goto` command calls the `GoToCommand#execute(Model, String)` method, which calls the
`Model#updateMonthView(String)` method. It then calls the `ObservableMonthView#setValue(String)` method that alters the
observable month view.

* `expiring` command
**  For the `expiring` command, the Calendar will be updated accordingly to the month year of the specified date or
month year with the command.
** For example, entering these `expiring` commands `expiring my/9-2020` or `expiring e/11-9-2020` will change the month
year on display to September 2020.

* `list` command
** For the `list` command, the Calendar will be updated to the `system's month year`.
[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call the `ObservableMonthView#setValue(String)` method. Hence, the
observable month view will not be altered and the calendar will not be altered.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Calendar updates with the observable month view:

.Sequence diagram representation of the update of the Calendar's MonthView for the "expiring chicken" Command.
image::CalendarExpiringCommandSeqDiagram.png[]

Or alternatively, instead of step 2,

Step 3. The user clicks on the arrows at the sides of the calendar title to
change the month year displayed.

When a click alters the observable month view, the listener of the observable month view detects the change and the
month view display of the calendar will be updated according by calling the `CalendarPane#updateCalendarWithYearMonth`
method.

For example, clicking on the arrow on the right calls the `CalendarPane#changeCalendarToNextMonth` method, which calls
`CalendarPane#updateCalendarToNextMonth`. It then calls the `ObservableMonthView#setValue` method that alters the
observable month view.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Information displayed on the Calendar
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show expiring coupons by highlighting the dates with expiring coupon(s)
** Pros: Cleaner view of the Calendar with minimal information & may take up less space on the `Main Window`
** Cons: Lesser information provided with a glance

* **Alternative 2:** Show a condensed version of the coupons' details within the cell of each date
** Pros: More information provided with a glance
** Cons: Messy to look at when there are multiple coupons expiring on a date & may take up more space on the
`MainWindow`

We decided on alternative 1, to show coupons expiring on specific dates with highlights. This is because a coupon contains
much information and the calendar may look cluttered and messy, which may be aesthetically unpleasant to the user.
Furthermore, the user can use the `expiring` command to search for coupons expiring on a date or month year and have a
more detailed view of the coupons in the `CouponListPanel`.

===== Aspect: Whether the Calendar should update with the list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calendar updates with the filtered list
** Pros: User can easily relate and reference to the coupons shown in the Calendar to the `CouponListPanel`
** Cons: May overlook some coupons if the list is filtered

* **Alternative 2:** Calendar shows all the coupons in CouponStash
** Pros: View of all coupons and will not overlook any coupons even when the coupon list is filtered
** Cons: User may be confused if he/she sees a highlighted date on the Calendar when there is no coupon expiring on that
date in the `CouponListPanel`

We decided on alternative 1, for the calendar to update with the list in the `CouponListPanel`. This is because this
follows the Observer Pattern Design Principle. Furthermore, this will not confuse the user when the user sees a
highlighted date on the Calendar when there is no coupon expiring on that date in the `CouponListPanel`.

// end::calendar[]


// tag::archiving[]
[[Implementation-Coupon-Archiving]]
=== Coupon Archiving

When physical coupons are expired or exhausted, they would usually be thrown away,
or kept in the archive. Coupon Stash simulates this archive, storing these coupons
in the app so that the user can still keep track of it, and the savings they
generated.

==== Current Implementation

The archiving of coupons is facilitated by the `Archived` attribute of a
coupon. The following methods in the `CouponStash`,
`Coupon`, `Usage`, `UsedCommand` class and the `Model` interface facilitates this feature:

* `CouponStash#archiveExpiredCoupons()` -- Archives any coupon in the
`CouponStash` that has expired, and returns a new updated `CouponStash`.
* `Coupon#increaseUsageByOne()` - Increases the usage of a coupon by one.
* `Usage#isAtLimit` - Returns true if the current usage is at its limit
(abstracted by the `Limit` field).
* `UsedCommand#execute()` - Executes the `used` command input by the user.
* `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ACTIVE_COUPONS` - A `Predicate` function that filters
out archived coupons from a given `CouponStash`.

[#img-archiving]
.Overview class diagram representation of the coupon archiving implementation.
image::ArchivingClassDiagram.png[ArchivingClassDiagram]

Given below is two example usage scenarios and how the archiving mechanism
behaves at each step of each scenario. An activity diagram is provided first to
describe the general events that will lead to an automatic archiving of coupons
by Coupon Stash.

[#img-automaticarchiving]
.Activity diagram representation of the general flow of archiving of coupons in Coupon Stash
image::ArchivingActivityDiagram.png[]

**Archiving of Expired Coupons**

Expired coupons are automatically archived by Coupon Stash upon start up of the
application. The following steps describe how this behaviour is implemented.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The initiation of
`ModelManager` will also trigger the
initiation of `CouponStash` with any available saved data.

Step 2. The method `CouponStash#archiveExpiredCoupons` will be called from the
newly initiated `CouponStash`, and have its
`UniqueCouponList` mapped to a function that archive coupons that has expired
before the date of opening the application, and returns a new updated `CouponStash`.
This mapping function is facilitated by `Coupon#hasExpired()` and `Coupon#archive()`.

Step 3. The `ModelManager` will proceed to filter out the archived coupons from
the newly updated `CouponStash`, and return
a filtered list of active coupons. This filtering is facilitated by the
predicate `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ACTIVE_COUPONS`.

[#img-archiveexpired]
.Sequence diagram representation of archiving expired coupons
image::ArchiveExpiredSequenceDiagram.png[]

**Archiving of Exhausted Coupons**

Coupons that have exhausted its usages will be automatically archived by the
application. The following steps describe how
this behaviour is implemented.

Step 1. The user uses a `Coupon` in the current observable `CouponStash` with the
command `used 1`.
`UsedCommand` is created with the parsed arguments, and executed. The particular `Coupon`
will then have its `Usage` increased by one by calling `Coupon#increaseUsageByOne()`.

Step 2. The `Coupon` will then be checked if its `Usage` has reached its `Limit`, using
the `Usage#isAtLimit()` method. For the purpose of this explanation, we assume that
the coupon being used has a usage `Limit` of 1 and a previous `Usage` value of 0,
with savings in `MonetaryAmount`.

Step 3. The `Coupon` will have a new `Archived` value, which will be set to
`true` if the `Usage` has indeed reached its `Limit`. This is facilitated by `Coupon#archive()`.

Step 4. The `CouponStash` will be updated with this used `Coupon` with the
`ModelManager#setCoupon()` method. Under the hood of
this method, the current `FilteredList` will be updated to show active
`Coupons` only, facilitated by the predicate
`Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ACTIVE_COUPONS`.

[#img-archiveexhausted]
.Sequence diagram representation of archiving exhausted coupons
image::ArchiveExhaustedSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: The implementation to store archived coupons

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Coupon` contains an `Archived` field
** Pros: Easy to implement, lower maintainability.
** Cons: Saved data may get get considerably huge after heavy usage of
application.

* **Alternative 2:** Archived ``Coupon`` s are stored in another separate data file.
** Pros: Separates the logic between the two different `CouponStash`, e.g. ability
to limit the functions on archived `Coupon` s
** Cons: Sharply increases the maintainability and coupling of the application
with two data files.

Alternative 1 was chosen, due to the cons of Alternative 2. While a separate
file is akin to having two separate stashes of coupons, this would increase
the overall complexity of the application. `Logic` and `Model` would have to
deal with another set of data, and `Commands` may have to split up the logic
for different data sets. Furthermore, while saved data will be larger for
Alternative 1, it should only affect the performance of starting Coupon Stash
up, since most of the interactions with the program is with active coupons.
// end::archiving[]


// tag::updownarrowcommandhistory[]
=== Up/down arrow retrieve command history

==== Current Implementation
The retrieving of command history via the up and down arrow keys is facilitated
by the `CommandTextHistory` class. The command history is stored internally as
a `LinkedList` used as a stack with a `currIndex`
tracking the next command in the history to return.
The following methods and attributes in the `CommandTextHistory`
class facilitates this feature:

* `CommandTextHistory#add(String commandText)`
* `CommandTextHistory#getDown()`
* `CommandTextHistory#getUp()`
* `CommandTextHistory#commandTextHistory`
* `CommandTextHistory#currIndex`

.Class diagram representation of the command history retrieving function.
image::UpDownClassDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the up/down button presses
behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The
`CommandTextHistory` is initialized
with a stack containing only an empty string (`""`), and the `currIndex`
is set to `0`.

.Stack containing only an empty string
image::UpDownHistory0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 1`. `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered()` will
call `CommandTextHistory#add(String commandText)` to save the entered command
into
the stack contained in `CommandTextHistory`. The top of the stack (i.e. the
empty string) is popped off first, before
the entered command is pushed onto the stack. Then, the empty string is pushed
onto the stack again, thus ensuring that
the empty string stays at the top of the stack. Note that `currIndex` is not
affected.

.Stack after executing `delete 1`
image::UpDownHistory1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `delete 2`. `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered()` will
also save the entered command into
the stack contained in `CommandTextHistory`. As in the previous step, the new
command is pushed to the top of the stack,
just below the empty string.

.Stack after executing `delete 2`.
image::UpDownHistory2.png[]

Step 3. Now, the user decides to delete the second coupon again. We press the
arrow key up once,
and `CommandBox#commandTextField` has a listener that calls
`CommandTextHistory#getUp()`.
The `currIndex` is incremented, and then the command text pointed to by
`currIndex` is returned and
displayed in the program command box.

.After pressing the "up" arrow key.
image::UpDownHistory3.png[]

Step 4. The user then executes the retrieved command (`delete 2`). As in the
previous steps, this newly executed command
is pushed to the top of the stack just below the empty string. However, in such
a case when the `currIndex` is not `0` and
does not point to the top of the stack, it is reset to `0`.

.Stack after executing `delete 2` again.
image::UpDownHistory4.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currStateIndex` is pointing to the top of the stack,
then there are no previous commands to retrieve. Thus, the up button will simply
return the empty string. No changes to the stack and `currIndex` will be
effected.

The down arrow key does the opposite, it will lead to the calling of
`CommandTextHistory#getDown()`,
which shifts the `currIndex` one item higher (i.e. decrement the `currIndex` by
`1`), before returning
the command text pointed by the updated `currIndex`.

[NOTE]
If the `currIndex` is at index `commandTextHistory.size() - 1`, pointing to the
bottom of the stack, there is no next command to retrieve when pressing the
down key. Thus,
the down button will simple return the command text currently being pointed to
by the `currIndex`.
No changes to the stack and `currIndex` will be affected.

Below is a sequence diagram describing the events that happen when a user
presses a key.

.Sequence diagram representing retrieval of command text history with the up and down arrow keys.

Below is a sequence diagram describing the events that happen when a executes
a command text, thus triggering the saving of a command text into
`CommandTextHistory`.

image::UpDownSequenceDiagramAdd.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the key actions

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use `LinkedList` as a stack to store
the command text history.
** Pros: `LinkedList` is a better data structure that allows for more efficient
operations supported by stacks.

* *Alternative 2:* Use `ArrayList` as a stack to store
the command text history.
** Pros: `ArrayList` is more recognizable to people who are relatively new to
Java, thus reducing confusion.
** Cons: Stack operations are less efficient on `ArrayList` s.
// end::updownarrowcommandhistory[]

// tag::couponsorting[]
=== Coupon Sorting
==== Current implementation
The sorting of coupons in the coupon stash is facilitated by the following
static variables in the `SortCommand` class and this methods in the `Model`
interface and `SortedList` class.

* `SortCommand#NAME_COMPARATOR` - Comparator that sorts coupons by name in
ascending order.
* `SortCommand#EXPIRY_COMPARATOR` - Comparator that sorts coupons by expiry
date in ascending order.
* `SortCommand#REMINDER_COMPARATOR` - Comparator that sorts coupons by
remind date in ascending order.
* `Model#sortCoupons(Comparator<Coupon> comparator)` - Sorts the
`ObservableList` of coupons that are stored in `Model` according to the
order decided by the passed in `comparator`.
* `SortedList#setComparator(Comparator<Coupon> comparator)` - Sets the
comparator that determines the order of the coupons inside the sorted list.

.Overview of the class diagram representation of the coupon sorting implementation.

When a `sort` command is executed, the field to sort by is indicated by the
inputted prefix. The sequence diagram below describes what happens when a
`sort` command is run.

.Sequence diagram describing the process of sorting coupons.
image::SortCommandSeqDiagram.png[]

Depending on the prefix to sort by, `ModelManager#sortCoupons()` will be
called with the relevant comparator as its argument. The
`ModelManager#sortCoupons()` method subsequently calls the
`SortedList#setComparator()` method (not shown in the above diagram), which
leads to a change of the comparator of the `SortedList` stored in
`ModelManager` , thus triggering a sort of the `SortedList`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Persistent or non - persistent sort?

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Make sorting non - persistent.
** Pros: Sorting is faster as no write to disk is needed to make the new
order persistent. Additionally, with the coupons being sorted by the time they
are added to the coupon stash by default, there is no way to restore this order
without storing the time a coupon was added to the stash. Thus, the non -
persistent approach shines here as restoring the original order of the coupon
stash is as trivial as reopening the program.
** Cons: If a user prefers a particular default sorting order for their
coupons, they have to retype the `sort` command each time the program is
launched or each time a coupon is added or edited.

* *Alternative 2:* Make sorting persistent.
** Pros: Gives users more freedom over the default order of their coupons.
** Cons: Can be unnecessarily complicated to implement a hidden field stating
a coupon's addition time just so users can revert to the default order.
Additionally, it can be confusing to users when there are so many different
ways to sort.

In our usage during testing, we have never had the urge to have a default
sorting order when the program is launched. Plus, we feel that the simplicity
of excluding a sort by default order function will be well favored by users,
and thus we chose alternative 1.

=== Coupon Reminder
To ensure users are aware of expiring coupons and maximise their saving,
Coupon Stash reminds the user through a pop-up window, upon launching the
application.

To achieve this feature, the following methods in the `RemindDate` and
`RemindWindow` classes are used.

* `RemindDate#isToday()` - Check if the `RemindDate` is today.
* `RemindWindow#filterRemindCoupons()` - Filters out all `RemindDates` that
are not today from `RemindWindow`.
* `RemindWindow#constructRemindCoupons()` - Creates a `String` of coupons
that have their `RemindDates` today. This `String` is used in the displayed
reminder window.
* `RemindWindow#showIfAny()` - Shows the reminder window if there are coupons
to be reminded of today. If there are no coupons that have to be reminded
today, no window will be shown.

.Overview of the class diagram representation of the reminder checking implementation.
image::RemindClassDiagram.png[]


To make sense of how coupon reminder functions, let's dive into the specifics of
RemindDate
class, RemindCommand class and RemindWindow class.


==== Implementation of editing a coupon's RemindDate

The following activity diagram depicts what happens when the user runs a
`edit` command to edit a coupons's `RemindDate`.

.Activity Diagram representation of the flow of editing the `remind date` of a coupon.
image::EditRemindActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation of reminder pop up

After establishing the remind dates for all the coupons,
the next step is ensure that there will be a reminder pop
up (if necessary) upon opening the application.

The following steps describe how to reminder pop up works:

. The user launches Coupon Stash. The `start` method
in `MainApp` class will kick start the program
by setting up the stage, along with the saved data.
. This will trigger the `start` method in `UiManager`, which leads to the
creation of a new `RemindWindow` instance, with a `List` of all coupons
currently stored passed in as a parameter.
. In the constructor of `RemindWindow`, coupons that do not have a remind
date of today are filtered out.
. After filtering the coupons, if there are coupons to be reminded today,
their information will be concatenated into a `String` that is displayed in
the reminder window.

.Sequence diagram describing the process of opening the reminder window.
image::RemindSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design consideration

*Aspect: How to keep track of coupon remind date*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Coupon contains a `Remind` field.

** Pros: Code implementation is easier and this makes the remind date more
visible to the user since it is a field.

** Cons: Coupon display may get very cluttered with the addition of this
extra field.

* *Alternative 2 :* Store the remind dates of all coupons in a separate data
file. Coupons can be stored in a hash table with their remind dates as keys.

** Pros: No need to clutter coupon display with additional fields. Plus, it
is efficient to list all coupons that have to be reminded for on a certain
day as the coupons are stored in a hash table.

** Cons: Hard to maintain two separate data files that have shared components
(in this case coupons)

All in all, we chose alternative 1 as we feel that it is good for users to be
able to view the remind date of a coupon in the coupon view. Additionally, all
speed-ups and efficiency of storing the remind dates in a separate data file
is nullified by the fact that we still need to loop through all coupons to
display their remind dates on the calendar component. Thus, to make it easier
to extend the program in the future, we decided against adding another data
file which can make extension more complicated, and chose to work with
alternative 1.

// tag::savings[]
=== Savings per use and total amount saved

To allow users to keep track of how much they have saved
(after all, the whole point of coupons is to offer
certain tangible benefits, encouraging purchases
by customers), Coupon Stash automatically tracks the
user's savings as they use their coupons that are
handled in the application.

To achieve this, ``Coupon``s have to store two different
fields: +
1. Amount of savings each use of a coupon provides +
2. Total amount of savings accumulated
from using a certain coupon

==== Class structure of `Savings`

Just for reference, the image below shows the class diagram
for the `Savings` class. It is compulsory for each Coupon to
contain an `Savings` object, that represents what the user
would gain from 1 use of that Coupon.

.Class diagram describing the structure of `Savings`.
image::SavingsClassDiagram.png[]

A Savings object can hold a `PercentageAmount`, `MonetaryAmount` or
``Saveable``s, which represents discounts like "$5 off", "10% off"
and "free door gift" respectively.

The table below shows which are valid Savings objects, and
which are not.

.A list of different Savings objects, which could be valid or invalid.
[cols="2"]
|=========================================
|Object Diagram | Comments
a|
.Savings with percentage amount.
image:s1valid.png[] | Valid
a|
.Savings with monetary amount.
image:s2valid.png[] | Valid
a|
.Savings with saveable items.
image:s3valid.png[] | Valid
a|
.Savings without any fields present.
image:s4invalid.png[] | Invalid: `Savings` must have at
least one field
a|
.Savings with percentage amount and a saveable item.
image:s5valid.png[] | Valid: `Savings` can have both a
percentage amount and saveables
a|
.Savings with monetary amount and multiple saveable items.
image:s6valid.png[] | Valid: `Savings` can hold more
than one `Saveable`
a|
.Savings with monetary amount and percentage amount.
image:s7invalid.png[] | Invalid: Savings cannot have both a
`MonetaryAmount` and `PercentageAmount`
|=========================================

As can be seen from the table, `Savings` cannot be completely
empty, and `Savings` cannot have both a `MonetaryAmount` and
`PercentageAmount` (it does not make much sense to have
a voucher that says "10% and $5 off").

==== `PureMonetarySavings` and `DateSavingsSumMap`

In order to calculate the total amount saved, ``Coupon``s also
store information about how much the user saves, and storage
is done at the moment the user uses the coupon. This
information is stored in the form of `PureMonetarySavings`,
which is a subclass of `Savings` that never holds
``PercentageAmount``s. The class diagram below illustrates this.

.Class diagram describing the structure of `PureMonetarySavings`.
image::PureMonetarySavingsClassDiagram.png[]

The reason why ``PercentageAmount``s are not allowed in
accumulated savings is because a percentage
discount is a relative value that depends on the
original price of the product, and cannot be easily
added up in a way that allows users to accurately
measure how much they have saved from their coupons.

[[dssm]]
`PureMonetarySavings` are stored in
a `DateSavingsSumMap`, which is a hash table that
links the current date (`LocalDate`) to the savings
earned (`PureMonetarySavings`) on that date.
Each `Coupon` holds a `DateSavingsSumMap`. The
next image shows the class diagram of the
`DateSavingsSumMap`.

.Class diagram describing the structure of `DateSavingsSumMap`.
image::DateSavingsSumMapClassDiagram.png[]


The following section describes
the processes that follow whenever a user marks a Coupon
as "used" with the `used` command.

==== Implementation of used command

When the user enters a `used` command, the actions taken by Coupon
Stash change depending on whether the Coupon's Savings stores
a MonetaryAmount of PercentageAmount. The following activity diagram
shows what happens when the user runs a used command.

.Activity diagram showing the execution of a used command.
image::UsedCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

In terms of the implementation, the next two images
shows the sequence diagram that models the successful
execution of a used command within the actual
program components.

More specifically, the used command executed is
`used 1 $100`, and the state of the system is such that
a `Coupon` with `PercentageAmount` in its `Savings` (no
`MonetaryAmount`) and with `Usage` not at its `Limit`
is located at index 1. Also, the money symbol
set in the user preferences would be `$`, which
makes this command a valid one that will execute
successfully.

.Sequence diagram showing how a `UsedCommand` is executed.
image::UsedCommandSeqDiagram.png[]

The money symbol set in the user preferences is
retrieved by `CouponStashParser`, which passes it
to `UsedCommandParser` that will use this symbol
to parse the `used` command.

Also, within `UsedCommand`, the `UsedCommand#execute()` method
will cause the creation of a new `Coupon` with the
correct recorded number of uses and amount of
savings earned. The next sequence diagram shows
how a successful `UsedCommand#execute()` method produces the new total savings
value for the new `Coupon`.

.Sequence diagram showing how `UsedCommand` updates the total savings.
image::UsedExecutionSeqDiagram.png[]

In the end, the total savings value of the `Coupon`
is updated. This total savings is represented by
a <<DeveloperGuide.adoc#dssm, DateSavingsSumMap>>.

One key implementation within the `UsedCommand` is the checks
that it has to make to ensure the valid usage of a `Coupon`.
Below is an activity diagram to show the flow of checks within
the `UsedCommand#execute()` method.

==== Implementation of saved command

Now that we have seen how the `used` command works,
we can look at how the `saved` command works. While
`used` stores the amount of savings that the user
has earned on a particular day, `saved` retrieves
the amount of savings earned as recorded by Coupon
Stash, given a particular time period.

The saved command works similarly to the used command,
where a `SavedCommandParser` will be created by `Logic`
to split up the raw `String` into its arguments,
creating a `SavedCommand`. Let's look at how a `SavedCommand`
would be executed.

.Sequence diagram showing the execution of a `SavedCommand`.
image::SavedExecutionSeqDiagram.png[]

Hence the `SavedCommand` loops through all ``Coupon``s to add
up the savings earned from a particular time period,
or from all dates if no time period is specified.

==== Design considerations

Based on the User Stories, there is a desire for tracking
how much one has saved by using Coupon Stash, as well
as for viewing total savings easily. Below are
some alternative implementations of savings tracking
and viewing that were considered by the developers,
but were rejected in favour of the current
implementation.

Alternatives:

* Restrict each `Savings` to a concrete monetary value

This would make the implementation of `Savings` much
simpler, as there would not be a need for separate
classes like `PercentageAmount`, `MonetaryAmount` and
``Saveable``s. However, this might burden the user with
calculating how much they would save in terms of
dollars and cents, when many coupons and discounts
come in the form of certain percentage reductions
of the original price, as well as free gifts or
benefits that cannot be translatable to a concrete
monetary amount.

Hence, it was decided to rely on a few different
representations of `Savings` that can be earned from
using a `Coupon`, as well as a `Savings` class that
could refer to any of these representations, or
even a logical combination of these representations.

* Each `Coupon` stores a `MonetaryAmount`, `PercentageAmount`
and `Saveables` directly

This would eliminate the need for the intermediary
`Savings` class and reduce complication in the program
code slightly. But, it would be difficult to ensure
that at least one such field exists in the `Coupon`,
or guarantee that the `Coupon` would have one such field.

The `Coupon` class would have to hold the logic for
determining whether it had a valid combination of
`MonetaryAmount`, `PercentageAmount` and ``Saveable``s,
which does violate Single Responsibility Principle
as the `Coupon` class now has another reason to change
(if we would want to allow both `MonetaryAmount` and
`PercentageAmount` on a `Coupon` for instance).

Hence the `Savings` class was decided to handle this
responsibility, as well as abstract away the
implementation details of the multiple possible
values and combinations of these values. This allows
the `Coupon` to think in terms of an entire `Savings`
object, rather than handle multiple different scenarios
depending on which fields it has.

// end::savings[]

=== Logging

We are using the `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging
destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the
configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)`
which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination
of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in
debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file
location, logging level) through the configuration file (default:
`config.json`).
