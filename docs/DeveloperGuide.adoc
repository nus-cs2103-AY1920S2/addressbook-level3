== About this guide

This Developer Guide is a document to guide future software developers of the Calgo App by providing a sufficient and comprehensible overview of the project. +

While we aim to provide a reasonable amount of depth, do keep in mind that the goal of this document is not to serve as a replacement for reading the actual code. +

Welcome on-board the Software Development Team for Calgo! Together, we will inspire a healthier lifestyle!

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above describes the high-level design of the Calgo Application. From now on, all
instances of Calgo Application will be referred to as App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

The `Main` component comprises of two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
This component is responsible for:

* Launching App: Initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* Exiting App: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<<

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
In particular, the `LogsCenter` class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Writes log messages to the App's log file, for various classes.

The rest of the App comprises of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The User Interface (UI).
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The in-memory representation of the App data.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The file manager for reading from and writing to the hard disk.

Each of the four components:

* Defines its _Application Programming Interface (API)_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Apple`.

.Component interactions for `delete n/Apple` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

<<<

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/tree/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `FoodListPanel`, `DailyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component:

. Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
. Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

<<<

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `CalgoParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a food).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete n/Apple")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete n/Apple` Command

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

<<<

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

[[Model-Component]]
.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

. `Model` stores user's preferences in a `UserPref` object.
. `Model` also stores Food Record and Consumption Record data.
. This component exposes both `ObservableList<Food>` and `ObservableList<DisplayFood>`. The data stored in
these two list objects is reflected in UI. Therefore, any changes made to the data in these lists are shown in the UI in
real-time.
. To update the `Model` (and hence reflect the changes in the UI), `Food` attributes need to satisfy certain `Predicates`, which represent these changes.
. This component does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
To make `Model` follow the Object-Oriented Paradigm (OOP) more closely,
we can store a `Tag` list in `Food Record`, which `Food` objects can reference.
This would allow `Food Record` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`,
instead of each `Food` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given in the below diagram. +

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/life/calgo/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component allows us to save `FoodRecord`, `UserPref`, `Goal`, and `ConsumptionRecord`  data in json format onto the disk, and read them back later on during the next session.

This would facilitate the following functions:

. Load past user App data and preferences.
. Generate and save insights reports based on previously and currently recorded user consumption.
. Generate and save a user-friendly version of the accumulated `FoodRecord`.

=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `life.calgo.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::reportCommandDG[]
[[Implementation-InsightsReport]]
=== Generating consumption statistics and insights report +
(by Vineeth)

This feature allows a user to automatically generate a report that contains statistics and personalised insights based on
his or her food consumption pattern on a given date. Do note that the generated report is a .txt file.

The user can invoke this functionality by entering the `report` command, which follows the following format: `report d/DATE`. +

This section explains: +

* how the `report` command works and the crucial method it invokes during execution (In the Implementation subsection).
* the various aspects that were deliberated over when coming up with the design of the statistics and insights report feature (In the Design Considerations subsection).
* a summary that shows a simplified Activity Diagram that captures the essential logic in the execution of the  `report` command (In the Summary subsection).

Before moving on to learn how the feature works, if you want to see what the report includes, you can refer to our <<UserGuide#, User Guide>>.

==== Implementation

The specified feature is facilitated by a `ReportGenerator` object. If you are interested in how `ReportGenerator` fits into the architecture of Calgo,
refer to this <<Design-Storage, section>>.

To learn how the `report` command works, the most important method that you need to know is the `generateReport()` method from the `ReportGenerator` class.

Refer to the sequence diagram below to understand the top-level execution of the `generateReport()` operation after the user enters a valid `report` command.

.Sequence Diagram for `report` command: generating 2020-03-27_report.txt
image::ReportFeatureSequenceDiagram.png[]


[NOTE]
The lifelines for the `ReportCommandParser` object, `ReportCommand` object, `ReportGenerator` object should end at their destroy markers (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reach the end of diagram.

From the above diagram, creating a report for the consumption patterns on 27th of March 2020 involves the following steps:

Step 1: User inputs `report d/2020-03-27` to generate the insights report based on food consumption of the abovementioned date. +

Step 2: This input is saved as a `String` and passed into the `LogicManager`. +

Step 3: The `String` input is parsed by `CalgoParser`, which removes the "d/" `Prefix` and sends
the date input to `ReportCommandParser`. +

Step 4: Once the `ReportCommandParser` checks that the given date is valid, it creates a `ReportCommand` object and
returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 5: `LogicManager` then executes the `ReportCommand`.

Step 6: From `Model`, `ReportCommand` retrieves the required objects to construct an instance of `ReportGenerator`.

Step 7: With the relevant objects retrieved from Steps 6, `ReportCommand` constructs a
`ReportGenerator` object.

Step 8: Using the `ReportGenerator` object, `ReportCommand` invokes the *crucial* method `generateInsights()`, which prints
neatly organised sections of analysed data based on the `DailyFoodLog` of the input date. For the section that gives insights related to
the user's favourite `Food`, the past seven days of `DailyFoodLog` objects are analysed.

Step 9: This newly generated report is saved in the `data/reports` folder. If the report is successfully generated,
the `CommandResult` is true. Otherwise, it is false. This `CommandResult` object is finally returned to `LogicManager`,
to signify the end of the command and GUI shows a result message to the user.

<<<

==== Design considerations

Many of the design considerations made for `report` command are similar to that of the `export` command. You can check
out the similar design considerations over <<Design-Export, here>>.

In addition to those design considerations, the following consideration is specific to the functionality of the `report` command.

===== Aspect: How many days of past data should be used to analyse user's favourite `Food` for the suggestions section of the report.

* *Alternative 1 (current choice): Analyse past seven days of consumption data*

** Pros: This implementation is more efficient as it does not have to churn out all existing consumption data produced by the user so far.
** Cons: The reliability of the suggestions may be impacted due to certain special events such as buffet celebrations, in which the user may consume
`Food` that he or she does not usually eat.

* *Alternative 2: Analyse all data*
** Pros: The insights will be much more reliable and more tolerant of outlier data points.

** Cons: The efficiency of the `report` command gets worse over time and may cause dissatisfaction to the user.

==== Summary
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when user executes a `report d/DATE` command with a correctly formatted date: +

.Activity Diagram for Report command
image::ReportActivityDiagram.png[]

You can check out this code snippet to see how the `ReportCommand` object determines if there are no `Food` entries present
in the given date:

----
// if there is no food consumed on the given date, do not execute command
if (!model.hasLogWithSameDate(queryDate) || model.getLogByDate(queryDate).getFoods().size() == 0) {
   throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_REPORT_FAILURE + "\n" + String.format(NO_SUCH_DATE, queryDate))
}

//tag::goalCommandDG[]
[[Implementation-GoalFeature]]
=== Setting daily calorie goals for motivation
(by Vineeth)

This feature helps a user chunk his or her long term goal of developing a healthy lifestyle into smaller daily goals.
Psychologically, this helps to motivate them as the perceived difficulty of achieving the long term goal reduces.

The user can set a daily calorie goal with the `goal` command, which follows the following format: `goal GOAL`.

This section addresses how the `goal` command works.

==== Implementation

In addition to the `GoalCommandParser`, the `goal` command relies heavily on the `DailyGoal` class, which is part of the
`Model` component. Refer to the `Model` component diagram <<Model-Component, here>>.

To address the issue where a user does not want to set up a daily calorie goal, Calgo places a `DUMMY_VALUE` of 0 calories,
as shown in the code snippet below, from `DailyGoal` class. To cater to a wide range of users, it also has a broad range of acceptable
values, ranging from 1 to 99999. However, to guide users towards a healthy lifestyle, the App does display a warning
message whenever a user sets a goal below the `MINIMUM_HEALTHY_CALORIES`.

----
    // Values used for GoalCommandParser when parsing user inputted goals.
    public static final int MINIMUM_HEALTHY_CALORIES = 1200;

    public static final int MINIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_CALORIES = 1;

    public static final int MAXIMUM_ACCEPTABLE_CALORIES = 99999;

    // Default value, when user does not input a goal.
    public static final int DUMMY_VALUE = 0;
----

Refer to the sequence diagram below to understand how a `goal` command is executed.
.Sequence Diagram for `goal` command: updating daily calorie goal to 2000 calories.

image::GoalSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The lifelines of the `GoalCommandParser` object, `GoalCommand` object and `DailyGoal` object should end at their destroy markers (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reach the end of diagram.

The following steps explain the sequence diagram: +

Step 1: User inputs `goal 2000` to update his or her goal to 2000 calories. +

Step 2: This input is saved as a `String` and passed into the `LogicManager`. +

Step 3: The `String` input is parsed by `CalgoParser`, which sends the `goal` value input to `GoalCommandParser`. +

Step 4: Once the `GoalCommandParser` checks that the given value is valid, it converts the input to an `Integer` and creates a `GoalCommand` object and
returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 5: `LogicManager` then executes the `GoalCommand`, which in turn invokes `updateDailyGoal` method of `Model`.

Step 6: In `Model`, the `updateDailyGoal` method is a static method that generates a new `DailyGoal` object with the corresponding input. This `DailyGoal` object is returned to `Model`
, which replaces the existing `DailyGoal` attribute of the `ModelManager` with the newly generated `DailyGoal` object.

<<<

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Type of user input data that is required for goal command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a simple goal feature that accepts the user's inputted value.
** Pros: +
- The user is not daunted by the large amount of information he or she needs to provide to set a goal.
- The user will not feel paranoid as Calgo does not ask for personal data such as height, weight, gender and age.

** Cons: +
- The goal may not be effective unless the user diligently checks online for a appropriate goal and then enters it into Calgo.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a scientific method to calculate the basal metabolic rate of the user.
** Pros: +
- The goal is very effective because it matches their body type.
** Cons: +
- A lot of data is required to be inputted by the user.
- May cause users to avoid setting goals because of the large amount of personal data they need to store in Calgo.
- User feeling uncomfortable about setting a goal will also affect effectiveness of `report` command.

==== Summary

In essence, the `goal` command is a fun feature that is used to motivate the user and generate specific insights if the
user were to invoke the `report` command after setting a daily calorie goal.

Refer to the Activity Diagram below for a visual summary of the logic behind the execution of the `goal` command.

// tag::categoricalsubstringfindsearch[]
[[Implementation-FindList]]
=== Searching for specific `Food` via categories and substrings
(by Eugene)

This section addresses how the `find` and `list` commands work. As they are complementary in their functions during the search process, both `find` and `list` commands will be explained together here for better coherence.

The `find` command allows us to search through the `FoodRecord` (via categorical or substring search) based on what the user enters for the `Prefix`. Users may enter one and only one `Prefix`. The search results can then be displayed in the GUI's `Food Record`.

Meanwhile, the `list` command allows us to reset the GUI's `Food Record` to once again show all entries in lexicographical order. This can be thought of as the reverse of a `find` command. However, unlike the `find` command, the `list` command does not use any `Prefix`, and ignores any input after its command word.

[NOTE]
`Prefix` here indicates which `Food` attribute we are interested in. Categorical search finds `Food` objects with values that match the user-specified value representing one of the nutritional categories (`Calorie`, `Protein`, `Carbohydrate`, or `Fat`). Meanwhile, substring search finds matches for the user-entered substring in any part of the the `Name` or in any of the `Tag` objects belonging to the `Food` objects.

[NOTE]
For more information on lexicographical ordering, please refer to its relevant section <<Implementation-LexicographicalOrder, here>>.

The above commands rely on the `FindCommand` and `ListCommand` objects respectively. Objects of both classes use a `Predicate<Food>` object to filter through the current `Food` objects, where `Food` objects will be displayed in the GUI's `Food Record` should they evaluate these predicates to be true.

<<<

==== Implementation
To search via a particular `Food` attribute, we use a `FindCommandParser` to create the corresponding `Predicate<Food>` based on which `Food` attribute the `Prefix` entered represents. This predicate is then used to construct a new `FindCommand` object, which changes the GUI display when executed. +

The class diagram below shows the relevant `Predicate<Food>` classes used in the construction of `FindCommand` objects.

.Class Diagram showing the relevant predicates used in constructing `FindCommand` objects
image::FindListCommandPredicateClassDiagram.png[]

As seen in the above class diagram, each `Predicate<Food>` is indeed representative of either `Name`, `Calorie`, `Protein`, `Carbohydrate`, `Fat`, or `Tag`. Moreover, it should be noted that each of these predicates test against a `Food` object, and therefore have a dependency on `Food`.

<<<

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `find` command works, for both categorical and substring search:

.Sequence Diagram for `find` command: Categorical Search and Substring Search
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The lifeline for the both of the `FindCommandParser` objects, and both of the `FindCommand` objects should end at their destroy markers (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reach the end of diagram.

From the above, it is clear that both categorical search and substring search of the `find` command have similar steps: +

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `CalgoParser` to realise this is a `find` command, and a new `FindCommandParser` object is then created. +

Step 2: The `FindCommandParser` object parses the user-entered arguments that come with the `Prefix`, creating a `Predicate<Food>` object based on which `Food` attribute the `Prefix` represents.

- In the above diagram examples, a `ProteinContainsKeywordsPredicate` object is created for the categorical search via `Protein` while a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object is created for the substring search via `Name`. +

Step 3: This `Predicate<Food>` object is then used to construct a new `FindCommand` object, returned to `LogicManager`. +

Step 4: `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of the `FindCommand` created, which filters for `Food` objects that evaluate the predicate previously created to be true. It then returns a new `CommandResult` object reflecting the status of the execution. These changes are eventually reflected in the GUI.

The `find` command therefore searches through the existing `FoodRecord` and then displays the relevant search results in the GUI's `Food Record`. To once again show all `Food` entries in the display, we use the `list` command.

In constrast to `FindCommand`, the `ListCommand` constructor takes in no arguments and simply uses the predicate `Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_FOODS` to always show all `Food` entries in its `execute` method. This is described by the sequence diagram below:

.Sequence Diagram for `list` command
image::ListSequenceDiagram.png[]
[NOTE]
The lifeline for the `ListCommand` object should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


How the `list` command works:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `CalgoParser` to realise this is a `list` command, and a new `ListCommand` object is created. +

Step 2: `LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method of this `ListCommand`, which uses `Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_FOODS` to evaluate to true for all `Food` objects in the `FoodRecord`.

Step 3:  `LogicManager` then returns a new `CommandResult` object to reflect the status of the execution, in the GUI. The GUI's `Food Record` reflects the above changes to show all `Food` entries once again.

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Predicate construction source.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each `Predicate<Food>` is constructed using a new object of type either `Name`, `Calorie`, `Protein`, `Carbohydrate`, `Fat`, `Tag`.
** Pros:
- Defensive programming by building new objects rather than relying on mutable sources.
- Can reuse existing code and classes like ArgumentMultimap and their methods.
- Models objects well to reflect the real-world.
** Cons:
- May be more resource-intensive than other alternatives.
- New developers may not find this intuitive.
* **Alternative 2:** Each `Predicate<Food>` is created using a `String` which represents the keywords.
** Pros:
- Easier to implement with fewer existing dependencies.
- Less resource-intensive.
** Cons:
- More prone to bugs.
- Difficult to ascertain which `Food` attribute it actually represents.
- More difficult to debug as `String` type is easily modified.
- Does not reflect good OOP practices

===== Aspect: Enabling substring search.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Allow substring search for both `Name` and `Tag`
** Pros:
- Improves user experience.
- Can reuse common code as the approach for both `Name` and `Tag` are similar.
- Generally easy to implement substring finding.
- Can use regular expressions if needed, which are powerful and suitable for our purpose.
** Cons:
- Requires good understanding of the original project.
- Need to know the `String` type, regular expressions, and their implications.
- Need to implement searching via multiple types of `Food` attributes and hence introduces more dependencies.
- Need to implement a new `Parser` class to detect each relevant `Prefix`.
* **Alternative 2:** Only allow exact word matches for `Name` and `Tag`
** Pros:
- Can simply reuse large parts of the original project's existing code.
- Less prone to bugs.
- Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons:
- Diminishes user experience.
- May not fully satisfy the user requirements.
- Need to implement searching via multiple types of `Food` attributes and hence introduces more dependencies.
- Need to implement a new `Parser` class to detect each relevant `Prefix`.

==== Summary

In essence, this section focuses on searching which is implemented via `find` and `list` commands. +

The `find` command performs a categorical search if a value from a nutritional category (`Calorie`, `Protein`, `Carbohydrate`, `Fat`) is specified. Otherwise, a substring search is performed to find `Food` objects that contain the entered substring in their `Name` or in one of their `Tag` s. These rely on the `Predicate<Food>` object used in constructing the `FindCommand`, which depend on the `Prefix` entered by the user. +

Meanwhile, the `list` command simply uses the predicate already defined in `Model` to display all `Food` objects. +

<<<

The above can be summarised in the activity diagram below:

// tag::lexicographicalordering[]
[[Implementation-LexicographicalOrder]]
=== Lexicographical `Food` order
(by Eugene)

This section addresses how the GUI `Food Record` entries appear in lexicographical order, which is an effect of sorting `Food` objects in the `FoodRecord`.

Over time, users will eventually have many `Food` entries -- these should be sorted for a better experience. Intuitively, the lexicographical order is the most suitable here.

In essence, `Food` objects are sorted by the `UniqueFoodList` (which is inside `FoodRecord`).
Sorting is performed each time `Food` object(s) are newly added to the `UniqueFoodList`, or during the initialisation of the `UniqueFoodList` upon App start-up.
There is no need to re-sort when a `Food` object is deleted or edited as the order is maintained.

[NOTE]
For a better understanding of adding and editing `Food` objects using the `update` command, please refer to its relevant section <<Implementation-SmartUpdate, here>>.
[NOTE]
Although the the `list` command changes the GUI `Food Record` display, it does not actually perform sorting. It simply resets the GUI `Food Record` to show all `Food` entries, and is usually used after a `find` command. You can read more about them <<Implementation-FindList, here>>.

==== Implementation

The `UniqueFoodList` is able to sort `Food` objects because the `Food` class implements the `Comparable<Food>` interface.
This allows us to specify the lexicographical order for sorting `Food` objects via their `Name`, using the following compareTo method in the `Food` class:
[source,java]
----
public int compareTo(Food other) {
    String currentName = this.getName().toString();
    String otherName = other.getName().toString();
    return currentName.compareTo(otherName);
}
----

How the sorting process works:

* When the App starts up, a new `UniqueFoodList` is created from the source json file (if available) or otherwise the default entries, and the created `Food` objects are sorted as they are added to it.
* Existing `Food` objects are therefore arranged in lexicographic order by `Name`.
* Thereafter, `UniqueFoodList` sorts the `Food` objects whenever new `Food` objects are added.

It should be noted that sorting is only performed by the `addFood` and `setFoods` method of the `UniqueFoodList`, which calls the `sortInternalList` method. Not to be confused, the `setFood` method, which is used when a `Food` object is edited, does not perform any sorting. +

The sequence diagram below shows how the lexicographical ordering is performed when Calgo starts up:

.Lexicographical Ordering Sequence Diagram for App Start-up
image::LexicographicalOrderingStartupSequenceDiagram.png[]

Based on the above diagram, when Calgo starts: +

Step 1: We initialise the `ModelManager` object. For this, we use previously stored user data if available (by reading in from the source json files). Otherwise, we use the default Calgo `Food` entries. +

Step 2: Before we can finish constructing a new `ModelManager` object, we require the creation of a new `FoodRecord` object which in turn requires the creation of a new `UniqueFoodList` object. +

Step 3: Once `UniqueFoodList` is constructed, we introduce the initialising data into it using the `setFoods` method. This calls the `sortInternalList` method, which sorts the newly added `Food` objects in the `ObservableList<Food>` contained in `UniqueFoodList`, according to the specified lexicographical order (defined in the `Food` class).


Moving on, the sequence diagram below (which is a reference frame omitting irrelevant `update` command details) describes the lexicographical sorting process when `Food` objects are added (not edited) using the `update` command:

.Lexicographical Ordering Sequence Diagram for Updating
image::LexicographicalOrderingUpdateSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
This is in a reference frame as it is reused in the `update` section <<Implementation-SmartUpdate, here>>)


Here, the diagram describes what happens after parsing the user input and creating an `UpdateCommand` object. Since the `Food` entered by the user is an entirely new `Food` object without a `Name`-equivalent `Food` existing in the `UniqueFoodList`:

Step 1: We call the respective `addFood` and `add` methods as seen in the diagram, eventually adding the `Food` object into the `UniqueFoodList` and arriving at its `sortInternalList` method call. +

Step 2: The `sortInternalList` method then sorts the `Food` objects in the `ObservableList<Food>` contained in `UniqueFoodList`, according to the specified lexicographical order defined in the `Food` class.

[NOTE]
During an `update` command, we do not perform sorting if the user enters a `Food` object that already has an existing counterpart with an equivalent `Name` in the `UniqueFoodList`.

Any re-ordering will eventually be reflected in the GUI, facilitated by the following (in the case of an `update` command) or otherwise something similar:
[source,java]
----
model.updateFilteredFoodRecord(Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_FOODS);
----

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Frequency of sorting operation.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort whenever a new `Food` is added or during App start-up.
** Pros:
- Guarantees correctness of sorting.
- Saves on computational cost by not sorting during deletion or edits as the order is preserved.
- Computational cost is not too expensive since the introduced `Food` objects usually come individually rather than as a collection (except during App start-up).
** Cons:
- Need to ensure implementations of various commands changing the `Model` are correct and do not interfere with the sorting process.
- May be computationally expensive if there are many unsorted `Food` objects at once, which is possible when Calgo starts up.
* **Alternative 2:** Sort only when calling the `list` command.
** Pros:
- Easier to implement with fewer existing dependencies.
- Uses less computational resources since sorting is only done when `list` command is called.
** Cons:
- Diminishes user experience.
- May be incompatible with certain `Storage` functions.
- May lead to bugs in overall product due to incompatible features.

===== Aspect: Data structure to store `Food` objects.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `UniqueFoodList` to store all `Food` objects.
** Pros:
- Can reuse existing code, removing the need to maintain a separate list-like data structure.
- Based on existing code, any changes to the `Model` from the sorting process are automatically reflected in the GUI. This is very useful for testing and debugging manually.
** Cons:
- Many of the underlying `ObservableList` methods are built-in and cannot be edited. They are also difficult to understand for those unfamiliar. This can make development slightly trickier, especially in following certain software engineering principles.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a simpler data structure like an `ArrayList`.
** Pros:
- Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons:
- More troublesome as we require self-defined methods, abstracted over the existing ones. If not careful, these self-defined methods can possibly contain violations of certain software engineering principles, which may introduce regression in the future.
- May be inefficient in using resources.

==== Summary

The `UniqueFoodList` facilitates the lexicographical ordering of `Food` objects and hence how their respective entries appear in the GUI `Food Record`. This can be summarised in the activity diagram below:

[[Implementation-Export]]
=== Exporting the current `FoodRecord` into a portable file
(by Eugene)

This section addresses how the `export` command works, creating a FoodRecord.txt file showing details of all the `Food` objects currently stored in the `FoodRecord`. The information is presently neatly in table form and the file is created in the `data/exports` folder.

The `export` command mainly uses an `ExportGenerator` object to generate the file. All formatting options and methods to write the contents of the file are included in the `ExportGenerator` class, which extends the `DocumentGenerator` class.

[NOTE]
You may find the `report` command similar as they both create a new file for the user. You can read more about it <<Implementation-InsightsReport, here>>.

==== Implementation

Most of the work in generating the file is done by the `generateExport` method of `ExportGenerator`. You can access the class to view its methods for writing the header and footer components, which are relatively easily to understand.

However, the methods for writing the file body is likely where some explaining is required. Here, the formatting of the table body is determined by the following:
[source,java]
----
    private static final int NAME_COLUMN_SIZE = 45;
    private static final int VALUE_COLUMN_SIZE = 20;
----
`NAME_COLUMN_SIZE` represents the allowed space for the `Name`. If a `Food` object has a `Name` which is too long, the `Name` will be truncated and continued on the following lines.
Meanwhile, `VALUE_COLUMN_SIZE` represents the allowed space for each nutritional value of `Calorie`, `Protein`, `Carbohydrate`, and `Fat` in the table. These are guaranteed to be within a length of 5 characters when parsing, and should not exceed the given space.

The nutritional values will always be shown in the first line of their respective `Food` object after its (possibly truncated) `Name`. This is facilitated by the `printBody` method of `ExportGenerator`, which calls its `printBodyComponent` method and subsequently its `generateFinalisedEntryString` method, which performs the truncation and amendment of the `Name` as necessary.

Moving on, the sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `export` command works to create the user copy of the current `FoodRecord`:

.Sequence Diagram for `export` command: Generating FoodRecord.txt
image::ExportSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
The lifeline for the `ExportCommand` object and that of the `ExportGenerator` object should end at their destroy markers (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reach the end of diagram.

From the above, creating FoodRecord.txt involves the following steps:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `CalgoParser` to realise this is a `export` command, and a new `ExportCommand` object is created. +

Step 2: LogicManager then calls the `execute` method of this `ExportCommand` object. This results in a call to the `Model` to get the current `FoodRecord`, which is used to construct a new `ExportGenerator` object. The `ExportGenerator` is responsible for creating the FoodRecord.txt file and writing to it.

Step 3: `ExportCommand` then calls the `generateExport` method of `ExportGenerator`, writing the required parts to the file. This returns a boolean indicating whether the file creation and writing are successful.

Step 4: A new `CommandResult` object indicating the result of the execution is then constructed and reflected in the GUI.

[[Design-Export]]
==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Type of file to create.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a .txt file to represent the `FoodRecord`.
** Pros:
- Satisfies user requirements by allowing editing of the file to include custom entries.
** Cons:
- Need to define new classes and methods for file writing, which may introduce more dependencies.
- May be more resource-intensive than other alternatives.
- New developers may be unfamiliar with `String` manipulation and regular expressions.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a .pdf file to represent the `FoodRecord`
** Pros:
- The contents appear to be more legitimate.
- Can use external libraries for convenience.
- May be less resource-intensive.
** Cons:
- May not satisfy user requirements as the file cannot be edited easily.
- May introduce more bugs, additional dependencies, and become prone to external factors.
- More difficult to debug due to lack of familiarity with external libraries.
- May require more space.

===== Aspect: Abstraction for `ExportGenerator` and `ReportGenerator`.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create `DocumentGenerator` abstract class which both `ExportGenerator` and `ReportGenerator` extends.
** Pros:
- Good OOP practice, following its principles.
- Allows for code reuse and neater code.
- Able to apply concepts of polymorphism, if required.
- May be now easier to debug.
** Cons:
- Need to define new class, possibly introducing more dependencies.
- Need to identify what is common to both `ExportGenerator` and `ReportGenerator`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use an interface which both classes will implement.
** Pros:
- Similar to Alternative 1.
** Cons:
- Does not allow methods to be defined in the interface. (Some exceptions: default methods, etc)
- May need to repeat definitions which may be the same for both classes.
* **Alternative 3:** Do not use an interface or abstract class.
** Pros:
- Requires less effort.
- Does not introduce additional dependencies.
** Cons:
- Unable to reap benefits of the above alternatives.

==== Summary

In short, this section addresses how users are able to obtain an editable copy of the current `FoodRecord` using the `export` command.

The `export` command largely relies on the `ExportGenerator` class, which facilitates creating the file and writing to it.

The above can be summarised in the activity diagram below:

[[Implementation-ConsumptionManagement]]
=== `Food` consumption management
(by Ruicong)

This section addresses how `nom`, `vomit`, and `stomach` commands work. They are the 3 commands that you will use
to interact with `ConsumptionRecord`. `nom` allows you to add `Food`, `vomit` allows you to remove `Food`, and `stomach`
gives you a way to browse a list of `Food` within the `ConsumptionRecord` at a different date. `ConsumptionRecord` is an important
component because it serves as a backend for features such as `goal`, `report` and `graph`.
//Link to other ppls components

The high level idea of how `Food` consumption is managed is that `ConsumptionRecord` stores all the `Food` consumed.
Whenever `nom`, `vomit`, or `stomach` is used, a list will be retrieve and sent to a FilteredList. Such a list consists of `DisplayFood` objects,
for the purpose of displaying information compiled from each `Food`.
The FilteredList is an observable, so whenever it is updated, the GUI will be informed and display the contents accordingly.

==== Implementation
In this section, I will be walking you through the implementation of the `ConsumptionRecord`, what happens on App startup,
and what happens when a consumption related command is called. I will be talking about the `nom` command more specifically.
This is because `vomit` and `stomach` work very similarly, and you will see that it's easy to understand once you have read through this
section.

[[ConsumptionRecord-desc]]
In Calgo, you will find that the GUI `ConsumptionRecord` use a `uniqueDateToLogMap` to map each `LocalDate` to a `DailyFoodLog`.
As you can guess, `LocalDate` keys are unique. +
Each `DailyFoodLog` is related to a `LocalDate` object and contains 2 `LinkedHashMap`, one to map `Food` consumed to their portion,
another to map `Food` to an `ArrayList` of `Integer`, which represents the ratings given to that `Food` item consumed on that day.

// note that directs to main diagram and say it might be useful?

On App startup, `initModelManager` of `MainApp` class is invoked. This will cause `storage` to read consumption record data from a `.json` file
which stores App data. The `.json` file stores `JsonAdaptedDailyFoodLog`, which is similar to `DailyFoodLog` in every way,
but deals with `JsonAdaptedFood` class instead of `Food`. Notice that there are a chain of `toModelType` commands
called as we dive deeper into the method call stack. `toModelType` is actually the method to return a working counterpart of `JsonSerializable` and `JsonAdapted` classes
that will be delivered to the model of Calgo.

[NOTE]
So you might ask, what does `JsonAdapted` mean? Well, `JsonAdapted` classes are specially formatted versions
of their counterparts that makes it easy for the `Jackson` API to read and write to.

Here is what happens when different classes call `toModelType`: +

* `JsonSerializableConsumptionRecord` returns its equivalent copy of `ConsumptionRecord.`
* `JsonAdaptedDailyFoodLog` returns its equivalent copy of `DailyFoodLog`.

Below shows the high level view of the initialization process:


[NOTE]
For the subsequent sequence diagrams in the section,
the lifelines for objects should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


.Sequence Diagram for loading of Consumption Record
image::ConsumptionRecordSequenceDiagram.png[]

Now that the `ConsumptionRecord` has been initialized, the App can start interacting with the user.

Whenever the user enters a `nom` command into the GUI, a sequence of events occur.
Here is a a step-by-step guide to what happens in such a scenario: +

Step 1: `UI` component `MainWindow` receives the input as a `String`. That `String` is then passed into LogicManager,
which calls the `parseCommand` of `CalgoParser`. Suppose the `String` is "nom n/Apple d/2020-04-12 portion/2 r/7"
`CalgoParser` detects that this is a `nom` command. `CalgoParser` then delegates this job by creating
a new `NomCommandParser` object which will parse this `String`. +

Step 2: `NomCommandParser` gets relevant values from `Prefixes` of input `String`, and then checks with the `ModelManager`.
It specifically checks if there exists a `DailyFoodLog` with the same `LocalDate` as what was parsed so that it can use existing information if
they are already present. From all these information, a `DailyFoodLog` object representing the result of consuming a `Food` is created, and supplied to create
`NomCommand`. The diagram below shows how this happens:

.Sequence Diagram for parsing of Nom command
image::NomCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 3: `NomCommand` updates the `ModelManager` with the `DailyFoodLog` obtained during its execution by `LogicManager`.
Such information cascades down the layers of abstraction until it reaches `ConsumptionRecord`,
which updates its underlying 'uniqueDateToLogMap' aforementioned <<ConsumptionRecord-desc, here>>.

.Sequence Diagram of how Nom command executes
image::NomCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 4: `NomCommand` then informs the `ModelManager` to update its `FilteredList`, which gets information from the updated `ConsumptionRecord`.
Since the `FilteredList` is a wrapper of `ObservableList`, its update will inform the UI components that utilise JavaFx of changes.
This results in the GUI automatically updating to reflect the changes.

Step 5: A new `commandResult` object is created an passed back to `MainWindow`, and displayed in `Result Display`.

Step 6: Finally, the changes in `ConsumptionRecord` are saved to `StorageManager`.

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How `nom` executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `DailyFoodLog` to pass into `ModelManager` and then `ConsumptionRecord`.
** Pros:
- Maintain comprehensive layers of abstraction
- Allows code to be easily testable.
** Cons: Difficult for newcomers or even existing users to trace because of long execution path.

* **Alternative 2:** Bypass `ModelManager` or even not use `ConsumptionRecord` for storage of data during runtime by allowing everything to be done
from parser.
** Pros: Reduce dependencies on `ModelManager` and `ConsumptionRecord`, and make code contained in a single class file easier to navigate.
** Cons: Violates layers of abstraction set in place by previous structure of AddressBook3. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and reduce
cohesiveness of code.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the consumption commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a single `FilteredList` to store food for any day by repopulating it each time
a consumption related command is used.
** Pros: Only uses a single `FilteredList`, so it is clear which list you are using for display.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of speed when there are too many entries.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a `FilteredList` for each date, to store food consumed on that date.
** Pros: Faster retrieval for display of `ConsumedFood` items. However, under practical circumstances, the difference is negligible.
** Cons: May have performance issue in terms of storage because it requires many lists to be stored in addition to `LinkedHashMap`
in `DailyFoodLog` for each `LocalDate`.

===== Aspect: Selecting items to delete from `ConsumptionRecord` using `Vomit` command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use index to select item to delete.
** Pros: When the list is short, user can quickly identify the entry to delete.
** Pros: Convenient for user as he is required to type less.
** Pros: User need not spend effort remembering names.
** Cons: When there are too many records, user is required to scroll through records.

* **Alternative 2:** Use name to select item to delete
** Pros: Can utilise the `Result Display` suggestion to improve user experience.
** Cons: User face the hassle of memorising names and typing more.

==== Summary

This section is a summary on all the above discussed. I would do so with the aid of a few activity diagrams so that you
are clear about the flow of the processes covered.

[[Implementation-SmartUpdate]]
=== Modifying the `FoodRecord`

(By Zhang Xian)

This section addresses how the `FoodRecord` can be modified by the `update` and `delete` commands.

The `update` command allows the user to modify the `FoodRecord` by either adding a new `Food` into the `FoodRecord` or editing the
nutritional values of an existing `Food` in the `FoodRecord`.

From the user's perspective, the `update` command does either of the adding and editing functions. This implementation of `update` decides whether to
override an existing `Food` in the `FoodRecord` with new values, or create a new `Food` in the `FoodRecord` for them.

For better user experience, for all new `Food` being updated into the `FoodRecord` with the `update` command, the `Name` attribute
will be formatted to proper case. This means that if the user updates a new `Food` into the `FoodRecord` with the `Name` as "char kuay teow", the `Food` that
is stored in the `FoodRecord` will be of `Name` "Char Kuay Teow".

[NOTE]
When a new Food is updated into the FoodRecord, the FoodRecord is sorted in lexicographical order. For more information on how this is implemented,
please refer to its relevant section <<Implementation-LexicographicalOrder, here>>.

The `delete` command allows the user to modify the FoodRecord by deleting a specified `Food` entry from the FoodRecord.
This command takes in the `Name` of the `Food` entry to be deleted.

For both `delete` and `update` commands, the `Name` parameter is implemented to be case-insensitive. This means that `n/APPLE` and `n/apple` refers to
the same `Food` entry with `Name` stored as `Apple`.

==== Implementation

The modification of the `FoodRecord` is facilitated by `UniqueFoodList`, which is responsible for storing all the `Food` entries in the `FoodRecord`.
Additional abstractions were used by `Model` and `Logic` for any operations that results in a modification of the `UniqueFoodList`.

Both commands require an additional operation, `hasFood`, in `FoodRecord` to be implemented. `hasFood` checks if there is an existing `Food` in `FoodRecord`
by checking if there is any `Food` in the `FoodRecord` with the same `Name`. Two `Food` entries is deemed to be of the same `Name` if their lowercase variant
is the same.

This operation was exposed in the `Model` interface as `hasFood`, allowing `UpdateCommand` and `DeleteCommand` this functionality.

===== Implementation of `update` command:

For the `update` command, the `hasFood` operation decides whether `UpdateCommand` adds a new `Food` into `UniqueFoodList` or
edits the nutritional values of an existing `Food` in the `UniqueFoodList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `update` operation works in both cases:

.Sequence Diagram for `update` command
image::UpdateSequenceDiagram.png[]
NOTE: The lifeline for `UpdateCommandParser` and `UpdateCommand` should end at their destroy markers (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reach the end of diagram.

How the `update` command works:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input of `update n/apple cal/52 p/2 c/14 f/1", using `CalgoParser` to realise this is
an `update` command and creates a new `UpdateCommandParser` object.

Step 2: `UpdateCommandParser` then parses the arguments provided by `CalgoParser` with the `parse` method.
During this parsing process, `UpdateCommandParser` calls the `covertToTitleCase` method on the `Name` argument, converting it
to proper case.

Step 3: `UpdateCommandParser` then creates a new `UpdateCommand` object, which `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method with this object
as an argument.

Step 4: `UpdateCommand` now checks if there exists an existing `Food` in the `FoodRecord` by calling `Model` 's
`hasFood` method.

Step 5:

* Scenario 1:
If Food already exists in the `FoodRecord`:
** Model calls the `getExistingFood` method with the user inputted `Food`
as a parameter to get the existing `Food`, `existingFood` in the `UniqueFoodList`. It thens call the `setFood` method to replace the
existing `Food` in the `UniqueFoodList` with the new `Food` which contains new nutritional values.

* Scenario 2:
If `Food` does not exist in `FoodRecord`:
** This scenario is handled by the Lexicographical Ordering feature. Please refer to its relevant section <<Implementation-LexicographicalOrder, here>>.
** Model calls the `addFood` method with the user inputted `Food` as a parameter to add the new `Food` into the `UniqueFoodList` in `FoodRecord`
** After the `Food` is added into the `UniqueFoodList`, the `UniqueFoodList` is also sorted in lexicographical order.

Step 6: A new `CommandResult` object is then created and returned back to `LogicManager`.

===== Implementation of `delete` command:

For the `delete` command, the `hasFood` operation allows `UpdateCommand` to check whether the Food that the user requests to be
deleted exists in the `UniqueFoodList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete` command works:

.Sequence Diagram for `delete` command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` should end at their destroy markers (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reach the end of diagram.


How the `delete` command works:

Step 1:  `LogicManager` executes the user input of "delete n/Apple", using `CalgoParser` to realise this is
an `delete` command and creates a new `DeleteCommandParser` object.

Step 2: `DeleteCommandParser` then parses the arguments provided by `CalgoParser` with the `parse` method, before creating a new
`DeleteCommand` object that is returned back to the `LogicManager` which calls the `execute` method with this as an argument.

Step 3: `DeleteCommand` now checks if there exists an existing `Food` in the `FoodRecord` by calling `Model`'s `hasFood` method, which
checks if there is such `Food` in the `UniqueFoodList`.

Step 4: `Model` then calls the `getExistingFood` method to return the `Food` object to be removed from the `UniqueFoodList`. Thereafter,
`Model` calls the `deleteFood` method with this `Food` object as an argument to remove this `Food` from the `UniqueFoodList`.

Step 5: A new `CommandResult` object is then created and returned back to the `LogicManager`.

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Updating the `FoodRecord` when there is an existing `Food` item in `FoodRecord`

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Overrides the existing `Food` item with the new `Food` item
** Pros:
*** No need for an additional command of `edit` just for the user to edit an existing `Food` item in the `FoodRecord`.
** Cons:
*** Might not be intuitive for the user since the word "update" is generally assumed to be for editing something only and not necessarily adding something.
*** May result in additional performance overhead.

* *Alternative 2:* Informs the user that there is already an existing `Food` item, and direct him to use another command `edit` to edit the existing `Food` instead.
** Pros:
*** More intuitive for user, since he might not know that he is overriding an existing `Food` item
** Cons:
*** Additional command has to be created just to handle editing
*** More tedious for user since more steps are required to achieve the same result.

==== Summary

In summary, this section explains how commands related to modifying the `FoodRecord` is implemented.

The `update` command is a smart command that either updates an existing `Food` entry in the `FoodRecord` with new nutritional information,
or updates a new `Food` item into the `FoodRecord`
The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user enters a valid `update` command:

.Activity Diagram for `update` command

The `delete` command allows the user to remove a `Food` entry from the `FoodRecord` by specifying it's `Name` as an parameter.

[[Implementation-RealTimeSuggestion]]

=== Real-time Suggestions for existing `Food` in `FoodRecord`

(By Zhang Xian)

This section addresses how the GUI `Result Display` suggests `Food` with similar `Name` to the user for the commands `update`, `delete` and `nom`.

When the user have many `Food` entries in the `FoodRecord`, they may have difficulties finding out if a particular `Food` exists in the `FoodRecord`.
For better user experience, this feature listens to the input of the user for these three commands and suggests similar existing `Food` entries in real time in the GUI's
`Result Display`.

This feature listens to the input of the user after the `Prefix` `n/` and checks if there is a `Food` entry in the `FoodRecord` with a similar `Name`.

[NOTE]
The `Name` parameter is case-insensitive and searches the `Food` entries in the `FoodRecord` by whether they start with the user input so far after the
`Prefix` `n/`.

==== Implementation

To be able to process user's input in real-time, we set a `listener` in the `CommandBox` to listen for the input of any of the three commands: `update`, `delete` or `nom`
This feature is then facilitated by different objects, mainly `MainWindow` and `UniqueFoodList`. `MainWindow` interacts with `LogicManager` 's method of `getSimilarFood` which exposes
the `FoodRecord`, allowing a filtered list of similar `Food` entries in the `UniqueFoodList` to be returned back to the user.

A predicate, `FoodRecordContainsFoodNamePredicate` is also essential in this implementation in ensuring that the correct similar `Food` items can be filtered from the `UniqueFoodList`
back to the `LogicManager` to be displayed by the GUI. The `test` method of this predicate which is responsible for the above is shown:
[source,java]
----
public boolean test(Food food) {
    boolean foodStartsWithInputFoodName = food.getName().fullName.toLowerCase()
        .startsWith(foodName.toLowerCase().trim());
    boolean inputFoodNameStartsWithFood = foodName.toLowerCase().trim()
        .startsWith(food.getName().fullName.toLowerCase());

    return foodStartsWithInputFoodName || inputFoodNameStartsWithFood;
}
----
Both of the `boolean` used for this predicate is essential. For instance, if "Laksa is already present" in the `FoodRecord`:

- If the user keys in "Lak", the first `boolean` `foodStartsWithInputFoodName` ensures that "Laksa" will be suggested to the user.
- If the user keys in "Laksa Spicy", the second `boolean` `inputFoodNameStartsWithFood` ensures that "Laksa" will be suggested to the user.

The following sequence diagram will explain how the different objects interact to achieve the Real-time Suggestion Feature.

.Real-time Suggestion Feature Sequence Diagram
image::RealTimeSuggestionSequenceDiagram.png[]

Based on the above diagram, when a user has already entered any of the `CommandWord`: `update`, `delete` or `nom`, and also the Prefix `n/`:

Step 1: `CommandBox` calls the `MainWindow` method of `getSuggestions` with the parameter as the entire `String` of user input in the `CommandBox`.

Step 2: `MainWindow` then parses the user inputted `String` and calls `LogicManager` method of `getSimilarFood` with the parameter `foodName` which is the entire `String` after the `Prefix` `n/`

Step 3: The `Model` then does the necessary work by calling methods `getFoodRecord` and `getFoodList`. This results in the current `UniqueFoodList` being returned

Step 4: The `UniqueFoodList` is then filtered with the `Predicate<Food>`, `FoodRecordContainsFoodNamePredicate` which returns a `List<Food>` of `Food` objects that have similar `Name` fields to the user input.

Step 5: Finally, the filtered `List<Food>` is then parsed into a `String` for the user by the `MainWindow` and then displayed in the GUI's `Result Display`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How the suggestions is shown to the user.
* *Alternative 1: (current choice):* `ResultDisplay` displays the names of similar `Food` entries in `Food Record`.
** Pros:
*** Improved user experience, allowing user to still view the unfiltered `FoodRecord` in the GUI.
*** User can have access to the raw `String` of the `Name` similar `Food` entries for copying and pasting.

** Cons:
*** Additional interacting with `UI` components required, instead of just filtering `UniqueFoodList`
*** Cannot reusing existing lexicographical sorting feature of `FoodRecord`.

* *Alternative 2:* Filter the GUI's `Food Record` to show similar Food entries.
** Pros:
*** Feature is limited to minimal interactions with `UI`, making use of existing `UI`-`Model` abstractions.
*** Compatible with existing code relating to the `FoodRecord`, allowing code to be reused.
** Cons:
*** Takes away most of the need for `find` and `list` features since they achieve mostly the same purpose.

===== Aspect: Commands that utilise Real-time Suggestions
* *Alternative 1: (current choice):* Only three commands: `update`, `delete`, `nom`
** Pros:
*** Improves computational performance, since real-time features for every command will be computationally expensive.
*** Keeps the desired outcomes of other features such as `find` and `list` intact
** Cons:
*** Decrease in user experience, as they might expect this feature to be universal for all commands

* *Alternative 2* All the commands
** Pros:
*** Better standardisation of feature across all commands.
** Cons:
*** Additional computational overhead.
*** Not all commands have a `Name` field.
*** Additional implementation or significant change in how this feature works is necessary to make it universal.

==== Summary
`CommandBox` listens for any of the three commands as mentioned, allowing `LogicManager` and `FoodRecord` to facilitate
the suggestions of similar `Food` entries from the `UniqueFoodList` to display in the GUI's `Result Display`. This can be summarised
in the activity diagram below:

[[Implementation-HelpGuide]]
//tag:: helpCommand[]
=== Command guide `help` command
(by Janice)

This section addresses how the `help` command works.

The `help` command allows users to reference a summarised version of the User Guide (called the command guide)
containing the usages of the commands and their formats, arranged in alphabetical order. Users may enter an
optional `command word` that filters the displayed command guide.

[NOTE]
`command word` filters out only commands which contain the `command word` as a substring. If no commands contain it
as a substring, an error message will be displayed at the top of the GUI component `Help Window` and the full command guide will be shown.


==== Implementation

To generate a command guide using the `help` command, a `HelpCommand` object generates the relevant command guides
based on the provided `command word` in the input.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `help` command works, should a `command word` of "nom" be provided.

.Sequence Diagram for Help
image::HelpSequenceDiagram.png[]

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `CalgoParser` to realise it is a `help` command, and thus creates
`HelpCommand`

Step 2: `HelpCommand` constructor generates the necessary mapping of command name to the corresponding command guide.

Step 3: `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method on the `HelpCommand` object, which produces the String containing the
relevant command guides. A `CommandResult` object is produced reflecting the response to the `help` command.

- In the above sequence diagram, one possibility shown, where the user provides a `command_word`. `setFilteredGuide`
will attempt to retrieve only relevant command guides, defaulting to a list of all guides if no relevant guides exist.
Otherwise, by default a list of all guides will be provided.

Step 4: The `CommandResult` is eventually passed to the `MainWindow` class, which then displays the command guide in a separate
window, using the `HelpWindow` class.

// end::helpCommand[]
<<<

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: How Help is displayed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** GUI component `Help Window` is displayed as a separate popup.
** Pros:
- User can refer to the command guide in a window separately from Calgo, keeping it present as they use the App.
- Command guide can give a more detailed description of command usage and format as it has more space to display in.
- No internet access is required as all information on commands is stored offline.
** Cons:
- `help` does not redirect to a url containing the most up-to-date User Guide. Changes made to the User Guide
must be updated in `HelpCommand` separately.
- GUI component `Help Window` might obstruct view of the App upon initially loading it, causing annoyance.
* **Alternative 2:** GUI component `Help Window` is not used, and instead content is displayed as part of GUI component `Result Display`.
** Pros:
- No possibility of a popup blocking the main app.
- All information is contained within a single window.
** Cons:
- User must use the `help` command every time they require a guide, as GUI component `Result Display` will be
overwritten after other commands.

===== Aspect: Command guides can be selectively displayed
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `help` displays all command guides by default. User can selectively filter to
display only desired commands by entering an optional keyword after `help`.
** Pros:
- Desired command can be more rapidly found.
- Removes all unwanted commands from GUI component `Help Window`, reducing clutter.
** Cons:
- Filtered `help` does not benefit users who don't know the command they're looking for.
* **Alternative 2:** Always display all command guides to ensure user will find the guide they require.
** Pros:
- No possibility of user being unable to find their desired command after sufficient searching.
** Cons:
- Relatively large array of commands can be overwhelming to a new user, deterring them from using the App.
- Can be very frustrating to search through for experienced users.

==== Summary
`help` will produce a popup, displaying a guide on the App's available commands' purposes and usage format.

[[Implementation-CalorieGraph]]
=== Past seven days calorie data graph
(by Janice)

This section addresses how the graph displaying the user's past seven day's daily total calorie consumption works.
Note that the graph counts starting from the date on the current `Food Record`, and the six days prior to it.

The graph will always display the past seven days' data at the bottom of the app, and will update
whenever app data is changed.

[NOTE]
If a command changes the date of the `Food Record` (such as `nom` or `stomach`), the graph will update to show data
for the past seven days from that date, inclusive.

==== Implementation
`GraphPanel` in the `Ui` component. It contains a `LineChart` of `String` date against `Number` calories, and is populated with
data from an `XYChart.series`. The data is in turn obtained from the `Logic` component, which provides only the past seven days'
of `DailyFoodLog`. The implementation of the `GraphPanel` class will be further explained.

`GraphPanel` class implements the following operations:

* `initialiseTreeMap` - Sets up the TreeMap that maps `LocalDate` date of `DailyFoodLog` to the `Double`
total calorie consumption n that day.
* `initialseGraph` - Sets up the `LineChart` with xAxis a `String` representing date, and yAxis a `Double` representing
total calories consumed on that date.
* `updateSeries` - Ensures the `XYChart.series` that populates the graph with data is always updated with the
most recent app data.
* `makeGraph` - Wrapper function that calls the above three methods.
* `getGraph` - Public accessor function to generate and retrieve the `LineChart`.

Calgo will display the past seven days' graph automatically, and likewise update automatically. It does so by having the
 `MainWindow` class call `getGraph` on startup and after execution of commands.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `Graph` feature works.

.Sequence Diagram for GraphPanel
image::GraphSequenceDiagram.png[]
Sequence Diagram for `Graph` feature.

Step 1: `MainWindow` requests for an instance of `GraphPanel`.

If no instance exists, a new `GraphPanel` is created. Otherwise one is retrieved. This ensures that `GraphPanel`
is a singleton.

Step 2: `MainWindow` calls `GraphPanel` again to generate the graph and add it to the `GraphPanelPlaceholder` inside `MainWindow`.

Step 3: Inside `GraphPanel`, a wrapper method `makeGraph` calls three methods in a row:

First, `initialiseTreeMap`, which has `Logic` call the `getPastWeekLogs` method onto `GraphPanel`, generating
a `TreeMap` of `String` date mapped to `Double` calories using the past seven days' `DailyFoodLog`.
Second, `initialiseGraph` method is called to generate the graph itself.
Third, `updateSeries` method is called to ensure the data populating the graph is up to date.

After which, the `GraphPanel` adds the graph to `MainWindow`.

<<<

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Choice of visuals for past seven days summary

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Summary is represented using a line graph.

* *Alternative 2:* Summary is represented in a table.

===== Aspect: When graph's dates are based on

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Dates are based on past seven days starting from date of `Consumption Record`, inclusive.

* *Alternative 2:* Dates are based on past seven days starting from today's date, inclusive.

==== Summary

In summary, this section addresses how the graph obtains information on the past seven `DailyFoodLog`, and correspondingly
produces a visual graph output onto Calgo's `Main Window` GUI component viewable by the user.

The graph requires the `LogicManager` class to obtain the information, and the `MainWindow` class to facilitate display
to the user.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>> below)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the App
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size


[[Implementation-Configuration]]


=== Configuration

Certain properties of the App can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Effort

=== Challenges and Difficulties

At the start, all of us were very new to software engineering projects. Hence, the learning curve was very steep. Because of this, most of the time, we were very confused. However, we demonstrated good teamwork because we always met often and helped each other out by explaining frameworks and teaching each other on software development tools like Git, Intellij and JavaFX.

Due to the COVID-19 situation, there was a lot of uncertainty and our style of meetings were significantly affected. However, everyone demonstrated good attitude and the team was full of good sports, so we covered each other's weaknesses and supported one another, therefore being able to realise a strong team potential.

=== Effort put in by the team

* 3-4 meetings weekly on average
* Many unrecorded hours were put in for self-learning and managing the project.
* We placed a lot of emphasis on brainstorming our features and implementing them to make it user-centric. For e.g. a real-time suggestion feature

=== Achievements

* Product Design
** Our team successfully morphed AB3 and its relevant tests into the Calgo you see today.
** Our team’s project idea was validated and appreciated by peers and tutors, most notably from our CS2101 presentation, CS2103T demo and PE-Dry Run testing.
It also has potential to be collaborated with other peer projects such as FitBiz (Group F11-2).
* Implementation
** Ambitious in experimenting with new interesting features. For e.g. intelligent insights and graphs.
** Implemented features consistently and incrementally, allowing us to make changes to past features and
** Experimented with new workflow before deciding on one, Agile(Scrum), which we liked the most.
** Put in additional effort in making the GUI different and novel, even though it is not part of the grading rubric. This is another example of how we go the extra mile to make our product more user-centric. For e.g. we tried out new JavaFX APIs like LineChart and TableView.
* Project Management
** Predominantly followed the forking workflow.
** Diligently created issues and assigned them on GitHub, while also consistently communicating with each other on Telegram.
** Planned and incrementally implemented our user stories throughout different milestones.
** Regularly reviewed each other’s code on and off Github.
