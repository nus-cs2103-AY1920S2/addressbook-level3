By: `CS2103T-F10-3`      Since: `Apr 2020`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

Refer to the guide https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-3/main/blob/master/docs/SettingUp.adoc[here].

=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-3/main/blob/master/docs/UsingPlantUml.adoc[Using PlantUML guide] to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other (Loh Sze Ying)

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete i\1` after navigating to Address Book mode with `nav ab`. +
The same type of interaction applies to other mode within NOVA, such as Schedule mode, Planner mode or Progress Tracker mode.

.Component interactions for `delete i\1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[width=500]

The sections below give more details of each component.

//tag::UI[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component (Yap Wen Jun Bryan)

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and `HelpBox`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files (HelpBox does not have a `.fxml` file) that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
//end::UI[]

[[Design-Logic]]

// tag::logic[]
=== Logic component (Chua Huixian)

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `LogicParser` class to determine which mode the user is in when they input a command.
.  After which, the relevant parser is called (e.g. `AddressBookParser`).
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.
// end::logic[]

[[Design-Model]]
// tag::model[]
=== Model component (Terence)

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* stores a 'Schedule' object that represents the user's schedule.
* stores a 'ProgressTracker' object that represents the user's progress in their project tasks.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// end::model[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save NOVA's data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes (Loh Sze Ying)

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.nova.commons` package.
All of the classes under `Commons` work independently.

Most notably,

* *API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/commons/core/LogsCenter.java[`LogsCenter.java`] +
The `LogsCenter` is used by NOVA to display logs when running NOVA in terminal.

* *API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nova/commons/core/Messages.java[`Messages.java`] +
The `Messages` is used by NOVA and deals with messages to display relating to NOVA's features.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::events[]

=== Manage Events (Chua Huixian)
The manage events feature handles the events of the user, including meetings, consultations, study sessions and lessons.
Users are able to:

* add events
* delete events
* add notes to events

==== Implementation - Deleting an event
The delete feature allows users to remove events from the schedule.
This feature is facilitated by `ScheduleParser`, `EventDeleteCommandParser` and `EventDeleteCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteEvent()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user does `view t\2020-03-20` to view their events on 20th March 2020.

2. The user executes `delete t\2020-03-20 i\2` command to delete the second event on 20th March 2020.

3. `EventDeleteCommandParser` creates a new `EventDeleteCommand`.

4. `LogicManager` executes the `EventDeleteCommand`.

5. `Model#deleteEvent()` is called, and the `Schedule` object in `ModelManager` is updated.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

image::EventDeleteSeqDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user inputs a delete command:

image::EventDeleteActDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Syntax of Deleting an Event

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** choosing the event by its date and its index in the list of events on that date
** Pros: relatively short to type, greater ease of implementation
** Cons: users have to view the list of events on that date before determining which event to mark as done

* **Alternative 2:** choosing the event by description
** Pros: more recognisable for users
** Cons: difficulty in implementing as certain events may have the exact same descriptions

// end::events[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Address Book (Loh Sze Ying)
The address book feature handles the contact list of the users. To enter address book mode, users need to enter `nav ab` command. Users are able to:

* add contacts
* edit contacts
* delete contacts
* find contacts
* list all contacts
* list category specific contacts
* add category specific remark for contacts
* edit category specific remark for contacts
* delete category specific remark for contacts
* undo or redo command
* add profile picture to contacts
* delete profile picture to contacts

==== Implementation - Undo or redo command

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete i\5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete i\5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[width=446]

Step 3. The user executes `add n\David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[width=446]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, `list c\classmate`, `list c\teammate` or `find`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n\David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations - Undo or redo command

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

==== Implementation - Delete a contact

The edit feature allows users to edit a contact from Address Book. This feature is facilitated by `AddressBookParser`, `AbDeleteCommandParser` and `AbDeleteCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deletePerson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete mechanism behaves at each step.

. The user does `list`, `list c\classmate`, `list c\teammate`, or `find n\[name]` to view their contacts.
. The user executes `delete i\1` command to delete the first contact.
. `AbDeleteCommandParser` creates a new `AbDeleteCommand`.
. `LogicManager` executes the `AbDeleteCommand`.
. `Model#deletePerson()` is called, and the `AddressBook` object in `ModelManager` is updated.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

image::AbDeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram shows how the delete mechanism works:

image::AbDeleteActivityDiagram.png[width=470]

==== Design Considerations - Delete a contact
===== Aspect: Deleting a contact by index or name

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use index tag to delete contact
** Pros: Shorter command to type by using index
** Cons: Users need to use `list`, `list c\classmate`, `list c\teammate` or `find n\[name]` command before deleting contact
* **Alternative 2:** Use name to delete contact
** Pros: No need to use `list`, `list c\classmate`, `list c\teammate` or `find n\[name]` prior to deleting contact
** Cons: Need to handle deletion of contacts with the same name

//tag::listPt[]

=== List tasks under IP project (Yap Wen Jun Bryan)
The list tasks feature for the IP project allows the user to view a list of tasks that were added.

==== Implementation
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list tasks mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user keys in `list p\ip w\2` into the command box.
2. The user executes `list p\ip w\2` to view the list of tasks in week 2 of the IP project.
3. `PtListCommandParser` creates a new `PtListCommand`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `PtListCommand`.
5. `Model#listTasks()` is called and the list of tasks is retrieved.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list tasks operation works:

image::PtSeqDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user inputs a list command:

image::ListPtActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: Adding choice of week to view tasks

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** adding in choice of week to view tasks
** Pros: more freedom to choose what to see as a user
** Cons: longer command to type

* **Alternative 2:** listing out the whole project tasks rather than letting user choose based on week
** Pros: shorter command to type and user can see all their tasks at once
** Cons: if user wants to see tasks only for a specific week will be harder to scroll and find

//end::listPt[]
// tag::view[]

=== View schedule (Terence)
The view schedule feature allows users to view the events they have added into the schedule. Users are able to view the
schedule by two time frames:

* By date
* By week

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user inputs a view command:

image::ViewCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation - View schedule by date
The view feature allows users to see the events happening on the specified date.
This feature is facilitated by `ScheduleParser`, `ScViewCommandParser` and `ScViewDayCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#view(LocalDate)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view by date mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user keys in 'view t\2020-03-10' into the command box.
2. The user executes 'view t\2020-03-10' to view their schedule on the 10 Mar 2020.
3. `LogicManager` calls LogicParser to parse the command.
4. `LogicParser` gets the mode from Model and passes the command word and the argument to ScheduleParser.
5. `ScheduleParser` checks the command word and calls ScViewDayCommandParser.
6. 'ScViewDayCommandParser' creates a new 'ScViewDayCommand'.
7. 'LogicManager' executes the 'ScViewDayCommand'.
8. 'ModelManger#viewSechdule(LocalDate)' is called and the schedule for the day is retrieved.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view tasks operation works:

image::viewDaySequenceDiagram.png[]

View week: Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view week mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user keys in 'view week i\6' into the command box.
2. The user executes 'view week i\6' to view their schedule on the 6th week.
3. `LogicManager` calls LogicParser to parse the command.
4. `LogicParser` gets the mode from Model and passes the command word and the argument to ScheduleParser.
5. `ScheduleParser` checks the command word and the preamble and calls ScViewWeekCommandParser.
6. 'ScViewWeekCommandParser' creates a new 'ScViewWeekCommand'.
7. 'LogicManager' executes the 'ScViewWeekCommand'.
8. 'ModelManger#viewSechdule(int)' is called and the schedule for the week is retrieved.

==== Implementation - View schedule by week
The view feature allows users to see the events happening throughout the specified week.
This feature is facilitated by `ScheduleParser`, `ScViewCommandParser` and `ScViewWeekCommand`.
The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#view(int)`.

The following sequence diagram shows what happens when a user inputs a view week command:

image::viewWeekSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
Aspect: View schedule by at most week and not month.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** View schedule up to week
** Pros: Easier to fit the events into the display.
** Cons: Less ways for user to view schedule.

* **Alternative 2:** View schedule up to month
** Pros: User can see their whole month's schedule at once.
** Cons: Might be too long and cannot fit into the display box. Time to gather all the events may be too long.
// end::view[]

//tag::studyplannerfeature[]

=== View available free slot of a specific day (Tan Wah Ken)
The view free slots feature allows the user to view their available free slots on their schedule.

==== Implementation
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the view free slot mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user keys in 'freeslot t\2020-03-10' into the command box.
2. The user executes 'freeslot t\2020-03-10' to view the free slots on their schedule on the 10th of March 2020.
3. 'ScViewFreeSlotCommandParser' creates a new 'ScViewFreeSlotCommand'.
4. 'LogicManager' executes the 'ScViewFreeSlotCommand'.
5. 'ModelManger#viewFreeSlot()' is called and the free slots for the day is retrieved.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view tasks operation works:

image::ScViewFreeSlotDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Calculating free slots given a schedule

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Embeds a free slot data structure to keep track of the free slots whenever
events are added
** Pros: no need to calculate free slots whenever user execute freeslot.
** Cons: overhead to add event commands, making its execution slower.

* **Alternative 2:** Calculates free slot based on the events whenever user executes freeslot
** Pros: easier to implement.
** Cons: slower freeslot execution.


=== Schedule events based on a task in plan (Tan Wah Ken)
The plan feature allows the user to create an event based on the task user created in the plan.

==== Implementation
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the plan task mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user keys in 'schedule p\task name t\2020-03-10' into the command box.
2. The user executes 'schedule p\task name t\2020-03-10' to create an event "task name" on their schedule on the 10th of
March 2020.
3. 'PlannerScheduleTaskCommandParser' creates a new 'PlannerScheduleTaskCommand'.
4. 'LogicManager' executes the 'PlannerScheduleTaskCommand'.
5. 'ModelManger#searchTask()' is called to search for the task user specified.
6. 'ModelManger#generateTaskEvent()' is called and one event with time determined by algorithm is created on the day
in schedule.

The following sequence diagram shows how the schedule task operation works:

image::PlannerScheduleTaskSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user schedules a task:

image::PlannerScheduleTaskActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Calculating best fit time frame for a task

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Plan gets free slot from schedule and generate event based on it.
** Pros: Isolation of modules.
** Cons: Redundant code.

* **Alternative 2:** Schedule decides whether to schedule or discard an event generated from task.
** Pros: more robust schedule.
** Cons: more difficult to implement.

//end::studyplannerfeature[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
