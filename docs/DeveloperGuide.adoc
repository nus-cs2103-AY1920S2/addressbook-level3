== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

//tag::ui[]

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PomodoroDisplay`, `StatisticsDisplay`, `PetDisplay` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

//end::ui[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram2.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TaskListParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user or highlighting the text input field with a certain color.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1, 2")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1, 2` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task List, Pet, Pomodoro and statistics data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task List data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pet data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Pomodoro data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Statistics data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== TaskList


Shown below is a high level overview of task class and related classes. This is represented in a class diagram.

.Task Class Diagram with all aforementioned attributes including recurring and reminder
image::TaskClassDiagram.png[width=790]


// tag::editTaskList[]

//tag::add[]
==== Add

===== Implementation
The Add feature allows the user to add a `Task`. Its only compulsory field is `Name`. `Description`, `Priority`, `Reminder`, `Recurring` and `Tag` are optional fields.

[NOTE]
Default `Priority` of 'low' is assigned if it is not specified.

[NOTE]
The user can specify multiple `Tag`s.

The mechanism of how `SwitchTabCommand` updates the `Ui` is described below through an example usage.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/Homework 1 des/Read up on Semaphotes p/3` to add a new `Task`. `LogicManager` calls execute on this inputs.

Step 2. `TaskListParser` creates an `AddCommandParser` to parse this input. `AddCommandParser` creates the relevant objects for the fields specified in input. Based on the input, it creates a `Task` with its assigned `Name`, `Priority` and `Description`.

Step 3. `AddCommandParser` returns a new `AddCommand` with the newly created `Task` as its only argument to `LogicManager`.

Step 4. `AddCommand` executes. It checks if the `TaskList` contains a duplicate `Task` to it through `Model#hasTask`. If a duplicate `Task` exists, a `CommandException` is thrown. If not, it adds the new `Task` into the `Tasklist` through `Model#addTask`.

Step 5. `AddCommand` creates and return the resulting `CommandResult` to the `Ui`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `AddCommand` is executed.

.Add Command Sequence Diagram
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when the `AddCommand` is executed.

.Add Command Activity Diagram
image::AddCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

//end::add[]

==== Edit
The edit feature allows the user to edit the task, adding or updating fields in a task accordingly.

===== Implementation
The edit command is done in 2 parts. `EditCommandParser` as well as `EditCommand` itself.

`EditCommandParser` parses the user input including the `index` and the relevant prefixes that will be edited. This is done by checking the prefixes for each of the different task fields and calling the relevant parser for it. The parser then returns the relevant field, be it `name`, `priority`, `reminder` etc and this is set in the `EditTaskDescriptor` instance. This `EditTaskDescriptor` instance is a container for the updated fields. This instance is passed in the constructor of a new `EditCommand`.

`EditCommand` is executed. During execution, an edited task is created from retrieving the stored updated fields data from `EditTaskDescriptor` and copying the field from the original task to edit for the unchanged fields. This updated task is set in the `Model` for storage. Subsequently, a new `CommandResult` is generated to display that the task has been edited in the result display to the user. The general flow of `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser` can be seen in the sequence diagram below.

.Sequence of executing an edit command
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]
// tag::editTaskList[]

==== Done and Delete (Fyon)

//tag::branson[]
=== Sort
==== Implementation
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/SortCommand.java[`SortCommand.java`]

.Sequence of executing a sort command
image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[]
The sort command takes in a list of fields and generates FieldComparators as seen in the diagram and then uses Comparator.thenComparing to aggregate the comparators. The first field provided will be of the highest sort order. The `Model` will then set the aggregated comparator on the `TaskList`.

.Class diagram of SortedList
image::SortedListClassDiagram.png[]
We use a new `SortedList` from JavaFx within `TaskList` because `FilteredList` does not allow for sorting. As such we have the `FilteredList` reference the `SortedList` and the `SortedList` refernce the `UniqueTaskList`. By warpping the lists around another, this allows the `SortedList` and `FilteredList` to read changes to the `UniqueTaskList` and perform the appropriate filtering and sorting.

.Sequence of initializing the Sorted List
image::SortInitliazeDiagram.png[]

Due to the requirements mentioned, this is how we generate our `FilteredList`. We set `FilteredList` to reference the `SortedList` and then the `SortedList` to reference the `UniqueTaskList`.

==== Updating UI
.Sequence of how sort updates the UI
image::SortUiSequenceDiagram.png[]

Meanwhile to update the UI on the newest sorting order, the latest sortOrder is set on the `TaskList`. The `LogicManager` is then able to access the sort order from the `TaskList` throgh the `Model` and provide the `MainWindow` with the sort order. The `MainWindow` then sets it on the `TaskListPanel`.

=== AutoComplete
Auto complete is triggered when users press tab while focussed on the command line.

==== Implementation
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/CommandCompletor.java[`CommandCompletor.java`]

.AutoComplete Sequence Diagram
image::ACSequenceDiagram.png[]

When a user presses tab on the command line, a key event handler in the `CommandBox` calls the suggestCommand function of `MainWindow` with the user input. The `MainWindow` then passes the user input through the `LogicManager` to the CommandCompletor. +

The input is pass through the `LogicManager` so that we can get TaskList details from the `LogicManager` and transfer it to the CommandCompletor (e.g. taskList length). The CommandCompletor then parses the input and returns one of three things which lead to different changes to the UI:

. `CompletorResult`
.. Will cause `CommandBox` to setSuccess on `CommandTextField`
. `CompletorDeletionResult` [inherits from `CompletorResult`]
.. Contains deleted input which will be shown as feedback
.. Will cause `MainWindow` to call setWarning on `ResultDisplay`
. `CompletorException`
.. Will cause `CommandBox` to setFailure on `CommandTextField`

==== Auto Complete Overview
.Activity diagram of auto complete
image::ACActivityDiagram.png[width=790]
[IMPORTANT]
=====
Auto completion of a word happens when either:

. the input matches the start of a target word
. the edit distance between the input and the target < 2.
=====
[#criteria]

The above diagram provides a big picture overview of decisions `CommandCompletor` goes through when processing user input.

. It attempts to complete the command word as in the callout above
.. if command word is unrecognized, `CommandCompletor` throws a `CompletorException` which leads to Unknown Command UI
.. else it performs argument checks and auto completes as necessary

===== Argument checks overview

. If the input is an add/edit/pom command then `CommandCompletor` will attempt to add prefixes.
.. add/edit command -> add priority and reminder prefixes
... Edit auto complete will only add prefixes after the second word to avoid adding a prefix to the compulsory INDEX field of edit commands
.. pom command -> add timer prefix
. If input is a delete/done command
.. remove any invalid indices that are greater than the length of the displayed task list or that are not a positive integer
. If input is a sort command
.. Auto completion of fields is performed based on the <<criteria, criteria>>
.. If the field is not recongized, then it is removed

==== Auto Complete output:
As seen from the activity diagram above:

. Known Command UI is displayed when:
.. Any kind of completion has happened or nothing has changed for the input
... `CompletorResult` is returned
.. Any input is deleted (invalid index or sort field)
... `CompletorDeletionResult` is returned
. Unknown Command UI is displayed when:
.. Command word provided is not recognized
... `CompletorException` is raised

==== Known Command UI

.AutoComplete Success UI
image::ACSuccess.png[width=600]

* `CommandTextField` is set to green
* `CommandTextField` text is replaced by the suggested command
* Feedback is also provided on what changes have been made
** If input has been removed, `ResultDisplay` is set to orange

==== Unknown Command UI

.AutoComplete Failure UI
image::ACFailure.png[width=500]

* `CommandTextField` is set to red
* `CommandTextField` text is unchanged
* Feedback is provided that command word is not recognized

==== Prefix Completion
image::ACPrefixActivityDiagram.png[]

Here we take a closer look at how prefix completion is implemented. We iterate through every word of the user's input and then check if the word is a valid task field. If it is, we append the prefix and update the hasPrefix boolean to true so that we don't append duplicate prefixes. The input is then updated and we continue iterating.

==== Index Completion
image::ACIndexActivityDiagram.png[]

Similar to before, we iterate through the arguments and we remove indexes that are either out of the displayed `TaskList` size or that is not a positive integer. We then append it to a removed list so that we can inform the user what input has been removed.

==== Sort field Completion
Sort field completion is done by iterating through all arguments word by word and performing the auto complete checks against all possible sort fields. The auto complete checks were the same as the above <<criteria, criteria>>.

=== Enhanced Find
We've built upon the existing find function in AB-3 to filter tasks based on phrases (with some degree of typing errors) and based on task tags.

==== Implementation
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand.java`]

.Find Command Sequence diagram
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]

* After setting the predicate on the model and `FilteredList`, the `FilteredList` will apply the Test method of the predicate.
** The test method calculates a score for every task and only displays tasks with score < 2.
* A comparator is then retrived from the Predicate by comparing Tasks based on their score and is used to sort the filtered list to show the more relevant searches first
** Lower scores means a more relevant task to the search term.
** Tasks with lower scores will preceed those with higher scores based on the comparator.

[NOTE]
====
Any existing comparator set by previous sort commands is replaced by the find command's relevance comparator.
====

==== Predicate
*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task/NameContainsKeywordsPredicate.java[`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate.java`]

===== Scoring decision
The score is first initialized to 2 and is later replaced by name score if the name score is lower than 2. We then subtract tag score from it to get the final score.

.Overview of predicate sequence
image::PredicateSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Name scoring
Please refer to the above's name score group

* The name score of a task is the minimum score of all chunks of a task.
** A chunk is a String subsequence of the task name that has the same number of words as the search term.
* We iterate through all chunks of the task name and calculate a score for each chunk.
* Here is how we set the score for each chunk:
** edit distance between one of the chunks and the search term < 2, chunk score is set to 1.
** search term matches the start of one of the chunks, chunk score is set to 1.
** one of the chunks is the same as the search term, chunk score is set to 0.
** else chunk score is 2.
* We then get the minimum of these chunk scores.

.Name scoring in predicate
image::PredicateNameSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Tag scoring
For every tag in the search term that appears in a Task, we increment the tag score by 1.

.Tag scoring in predicate
image::PredicateTagSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Final score
final score = name score - tag score. Search results are displayed in ascending order of final score.

===== Design considerations
. The idea is to first ensure that tasks that are too different are not shown while allowing some degree of typo error on the user's end when searching for a task.
.. This is supported by the use of edit distance and a small threshold.
. Next we also wanted the user to be able to find a task name without searching the full name.
.. We show tasks who have a chunk who's start matches the search term.
. We also wanted to allow users to search by tags.
.. Thus tag score is introduced.
. While the score helps to determine which tasks to show, it serves another job in providing the search relevance so that while accommodating for some degree of error from user input, they are still seeing what's more relevant first.
.. Users can also narrow their search by performing find with more tags or a more complete task name so that only that task has a chunk that matches.
. We chose to not use edit distance for search terms of string length less than 3 as this would bring about alot of false positives given that that the edit distance between words of length < 3 will easily be 1.

//end::branson[]

//tag::pomodoro[]
[[Pomodoro]]
=== Pomodoro
Pomodoro is activated by the `pom` command. It follows the same execution flow as many of the other commands in BBProductive.

.Interactions Inside Logic Component for the pom 1 command
image::PomSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Implementation
Pomosoero's features are implemented mainly in `seedu.address.logic` package. The `PomodoroManager` class is used to maniulate the timer and configure the relevant UI elements. The timer is facilitated by `javafx.animation.Timeline`.

When the `PomCommand` is executed, the `PomodoroManager` will handle the actual timer systems and update the relevant entities in the app. This is evident in the following sequence diagram.

.Interactions with PomodoroManager through a time cycle
image::PomExtendedSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

Through the use of the Pomodoro feature, there are occasions where the app has to prompt the user for specific input in order to progress. This behaviour flow is represented in the _Pomodoro Acctivity_ diagram.

.Pomodoro Activity Diagram
image::PomodoroActivityDiagram.png[width=395]

The `PomodoroManager` maintains a  `prompt_state` indicating what the app might be prompting the user at a given time.

*Pomodoro Prompt States*

* `NONE`: There is no particular prompt happening. The default state when the app is in the neutral state. (i.e. No pomodoro running.)
* `CHECK_DONE`: This state occurs when a timer expires during a Pomodoro cycle.
* `CHECK_TAKE_BREAK`: This state occurs after user response has been received in the CHECK_DONE state.
* `CHECK_DONE_MIDPOM`: This state occurs when the user calls done on a task that is the Pomodoro running task.

Pomodoro has settings that can be configured by the user:

* Pomodoro Time: This defines how long the Pomodoro work period is. The default is 25 minutes.
* Break Time: This defines how long the breaks last in between Pomodoro periods. The default is 5 minutes.

This data is captured and stored in the `Pomodoro` class in `seedu.address.model`, which interacts with the app’s storage system. `PomodoroManager` also updates the `Pomodoro` model on what task is being run and the time remaining in a particular cycle. This allows the time progress to be persistent in between app closures and relaunches.
//end::pomodoro[]
//tag::statistics[]

=== Switch Tab Feature

The Switch tab feature allows the user to traverse between the Tasks, Statistics and Settings tabs.

The user can switch tabs through 2 main methods:
1. User calls a valid SwitchTabCommand that displays the appropriate tab defined.
2. User calls a valid command that changes the display of Tab B while he or she is on Tab A. In this scenario, Tab B will display automatically.

This behaviour is represented in the following activity diagram.

.Activity Diagram of Tab Switches
image::SwitchTabActivityDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the SwitchTabCommand updates the tab in the UI.

.Sequence Diagram of SwitchTabCommand
image::SwitchTabSequenceDiagram.png[]

// tag::reminder[]
=== Reminders
The user's reminder functionality is achieved by calculating the time delay from the current time and the time from the user input. This time delay as well as the Task name and description is passed to the MainWindow for the reminder to be triggered as a pop up at the right time.

==== Implementation
A `DateTimeFormatter` is used to parse the date time from the user input, which is just the date in the r/ flag when adding or editing a task, into a `LocalDateTime` object. This `LocalDateTime` is used to store the date and time information. When the reminder is instantiated, a `setDelay` method is called setting in motion the calculation of time delay between the current time and the reminder time, and triggering of reminder on the `MainWindow`. The reminder class is stored as an `Optional` in the Task class itself.

Reminder is stored as a string in the `JsonAdaptedTask`. This string contains the exact format of the date and time that the user inputs, this allows the same constructor to be used when the data is read and changed to a task and thus reminder object. A sequence diagram of the reminder flow is shown below for reference.

.Reminder Sequence Diagram
image::ReminderSequenceDiagram.png[width=790]

// end::reminder[]

// tag::recurring[]
=== Recurring
The user's recurring tasks functionality is twofold. Resetting the task to be unfinished after the stipulated time interval and resetting the task's reminder date according to the stipulated time interval. The behaviour for this recurring feature is mainly represented in the activity diagram below.

.Recurring Activity Diagram
image::RecurringActivityDiagram.png[width=790]

==== Implementation
The logic is mainly implemented in the `Recurring` class and `ModelManager` class in `seedu.address.model`, which interacts with the app’s storage system especially with respect to task storage. This `Recurring` instance is stored in `Task` as an optional field.

In the `Recurring` class, whenever a task is added or edited, the recurring type is then parsed to be either daily or weekly. Afterward, based on the time the recurring attribute is added, a reference LocalDateTime is noted in the `Recurring` instance itself. This ensures that the first recurring behaviour will trigger in the given interval with respect to that referenceDateTime and following the same interval afterwards.

The recurring behaviour is orchestrated in `ModelManager` whenever a task is added or edited, a `setTask` method is called that will generate a `Timer` and `TimerTask`. A `TimerTask` is the logic run to update the task, namely resetting the done and the reminder accordingly. The `Timer` schedules `TimerTasks` at a fixed rate based on the the time interval chosen, if it is daily it will be every 24 hours (but for testing purposes it will be every 60 seconds) and if it is weekly it will be every 7 days. There is only 1 `Timer` for the `ModelManager` that handles the scheduling of each `TimerTask` that corresponds to every task that has a recurring behaviour. On boot the `Timer` is canceled and replaced with a new instance, subsequently all the tasks are iterated through. Every task with a recurring attribute will have a `TimerTask` generated and scheduled accordingly.

The recurring behaviour triggered will set the task as undone. If a reminder exists and has been triggered, it will increment the reminder to be the next day or week depending on the interval set. When the recurring behaviour is triggered, the result display will show a message that the recurring task has been reset.

Additionally, a flag has been made to check if the task needs to be changed, if it does not it will not be unnecessarily updated in the `Model`. A class diagram of the tasks and all its attributes is shown below.

Recurring is stored as a string in the `JsonAdaptedTask`. This string contains the LocalDateTime information for the reference date as well as the type of interval itself. A special constructor for this string is used to reconstruct the recurring attribute when reading from storage.

// end::recurring[]

//tag::statistics[]

=== Switch Tab Feature

The Switch tab feature allows the user to traverse between the Tasks, Statistics and Settings tabs.

The user can switch tabs through 2 main methods:
1. User calls a valid `SwitchTabCommand` that displays the appropriate tab defined.
2. User calls a valid command that changes the display of Tab B while he or she is on Tab A. In this scenario, Tab B will display automatically.

This behaviour is represented in the following activity diagram.

.Activity Diagram of Tab Switches
image::SwitchTabActivityDiagram.png[]

The mechanism of how `SwitchTabCommand` updates the `Ui` is described below.

Step 1. `MainWindow` executes the user input through logic and retrieves the `SwitchTabCommandResult commandResult` from `Logic`.

Step 2. `MainWindow` retrieves the `tabToSwitchIndex` from `commandResult`.

Step 3. `MainWindow` updates the `tabToSwitchIndex` tab through `tabPanePlaceholder`.

The following sequence diagram shows how `SwitchTabCommand` updates the tab in the `Ui`.

.Sequence Diagram of SwitchTabCommand
image::SwitchTabSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Statistics Feature

The Statistics feature allows the user to view information about their number of tasks completed and Pomodoro duration ran on a daily basis for the past `CONSTANT_SIZE` days.

[NOTE]
`CONSTANT_SIZE` can be set to any number for any future developments. In our current implementation, we chose to store data for only the past 7 days to keep Statistics simple and intuitive for users.

==== Implementation
The Statistics feature is mainly supported by the `Statistics` class, which in turn is facilitated by the `CustomQueue` class. Its class diagram is given below.

.Class Diagram of the Statistics Component
image::StatisticsClassDiagram.png[]

The `CustomQueue` class enforces the following constraints:

1. Size of `CustomQueue` must be of `CONSTANT_SIZE` after each method call through `Statistics`.
2. DayData dates in `CustomQueue` must be only 1 day apart between its elements, and sorted from oldest to latest date.

The `CustomQueue` class implements the following methods for other components to access or update its data:

* `Model#updateDataDatesStatistics` - Updates data to current day while retaining stored data.
* `Model#updatesDayDataStatistics` - Replaces existing DayData in Statistics with new DayData of the same date.
* `Model#getDayDataFromDateStatistics` - Returns the DayData object from Statistics with the specified date.

The Statistics feature does not support any explicit commands. Instead, `Ui` is updated and displayed when the SwitchTabCommand 'stats' is called. The mechanism of this behaviour is described below.

Step 1. `MainWindow` receives the `SwitchTabCommandResult commandResult` from `Logic`.

Step 2. `MainWindow` calls `StatisticsManager#updateStatisticsDisplayValues()` which retrieve the latest `Statistics` from `Model` and generates the display information.

Step 3. `MainWindow` then retrieves these display information from `StatisticsManager` and sets this information in `StatisticsDisplay`.

[NOTE]
`SwitchTabCommand` also switches the focused tab to the `Statistics` tab to display the results to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Statistics` is updated to the display.

.Sequence Diagram of how Statistics
image::StatisticsUiSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support Statistics

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list that stores a fixed number of DayData objects, with elements being strictly 1 day apart and sorted from oldest to latest date.
** Pros: Lightweight, does not store unnecessary data. Easy to pass data to generate graphs. Systematic removal of outdated data.
** Cons: Need to enforce constraints in methods.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a list with elements sorted from oldest to latest date.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Harder to pass data to generate graphs. Need to handle outdated dates.

===== Aspect: when to update StatisticsDisplay

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Update when the user runs the command to view Statistics
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Progress can only be viewed at the Statistics tab.
* **Alternative 2:** Update when any changes are made to Statistics.
** Pros: In the event of future developments, any component of Statistics can be displayed at all times.
** Cons: Need to keep track of all instances that can modify Statistics' values.

//end::statistics[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* has a need to manage a significant number of tasks
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* need motivation to get things done

*Value proposition*: We integrate a Pomodoro-Pet environment into a full fledged task manager. The pet system serves to gamify the act of doing tasks, thereby motivating users, and the Pomodoro helps users get into a regular work/rest cycle. This integrationcovers all aspects of productivity in line platform. It covers motivation, organising of tasks and also how to go about doing them. This all in one solution is seldom found in other applications which implement maybe 1 or 2 of these features.

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. In the home folder for BBproductive, launch the jar file by double clicking on the jar file itself. +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample items. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving user preferences

.. Add or edit tasks accordingly
.. Re-launch the app by double clicking the jar file. +
   Expected:  The same GUI list of tasks appears.

_{ more test cases ... }_

=== Viewing Relevant Screens on command

. On launch
.. Upon double clicking the JAR file, a GUI with the tasks list on the right panel appears.

. On typing stats
.. Type stats in the input command box if you are in either the tasks or settings panel.
... Expected: The right panel shows a GUI with multiple graphs.

. On typing settings
.. Type settings in the input command box if you are in either the tasks or statistics panel.
... Expected: The right panel shows a GUI with multiple fields for the settings.

. On typing tasks
.. Type tasks in the input command box if you are in either the settings or statistics panel.
... Expected: The right panel shows a GUI with the task list.

=== Adding a task
. Adding from a screen with 0 tasks
.. First run `clear` to clear all tasks if there are still tasks on the screen.
.. Add a task by running the command `add n/test1` +
Expected: A task card appears in the tasklist with the name test1.

. Adding from a screen with 1 task
.. Add another task by running the command `add n/test2` +
Expected: A task card appears in the tasklist with the name test2.

=== Editing a task
+ Prerequisite : Run `clear` and add a task using the command `add n/editTest`

. Editing a task's name
.. Run the command `edit 1 n/editedTest`. +
Expected: The command will result in the first task card's name to change from editTest to editedTest.

. Editing a task's description
.. Run the command `edit 1 des/testDescription`. +
Expected: The command will result in the testDescription being the description of the task card.

. Editing a task's priority
.. Run the command `edit 1 p/2`. +
Expected: The command will result in the priority to change from low to medium on the task card.

. Editing a task's tags
.. Run the command `edit 1 t/test`. +
Expected: The command will result in the test tag to appear below the task name on the task card.

=== Adding and triggering a reminder for the task
. Adding a task with a reminder. +
Prerequisite: Take note of the current time plus 1 minute and date in the format `DD/MM/YY@HH:mm`, for example if the current time is `15/03/20@15:47` then you should get the command ready `15/03/20@15:48` (but use the current date and time instead)
.. Run the command `add n/reminderTest des/test r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` +
Expected: When the time has arrived a a pop up with a title `reminderTest` and description `test` appears.

. Editing a task to have a reminder. +
Prerequisite: Take note of the current time plus 1 minute and date in the format `DD/MM/YY@HH:mm`, for example if the current time is `15/03/20@15:47` then you should get the command ready `15/03/20@15:48` (but use the current date and time instead)
.. Add a task `add n/editReminderTest des/test` first and see it added on the tasklist panel
.. Take note of the index of that task
.. Edit the task with `edit <index> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` +
Expected: The task displays the reminder date in the task card. When the time comes, a pop up with a title `editReminderTest` and description `test` appears.


=== Adding a recurring attribute to a task
. Adding a task with a recurring attribute. +
.. Run the command `add n/recurTest rec/d`
.. Take note of the index of that task.
.. Run the done command `done <index>` +
Expected: Although it is meant to be a daily recurring task and thus the time delay should be 24 hours, for testing purposes the time delay is set to 60 seconds. After 60 seconds, the done is set back to unfinished, with the tick being removed from the task card.

. Editing a task to have a recurring attribute. +
.. Add a task `add n/editRecurringTest` firs and see it added on the tasklist panel
.. Take note of the index of that task
.. Edit the task with `edit <index> rec/d`
.. Run the done command `done <index>` +
Expected: The task is marked as done at first. After 60 seconds, the done is set back to unfinished, with the tick being removed from the task card.

. Adding a task with a reminder and recurring attribute. +
Prerequisite: Take note of the current time plus 1 minute and date in the format `DD/MM/YY@HH:mm`, for example if the current time is `15/03/20@15:47` then you should get the command ready `15/03/20@15:48` (but use the current date and time instead)
.. Run the command `add n/recurReminderTest r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm rec/d`
.. Take note of the index of that task.
.. Run the done command `done <index>` +
Expected: After 60 seconds, the done is set back to unfinished, with the tick being removed from the task card. After the reminder appears, the date displayed changes to the next day, for example `15 March at 15:48` changes to `16 March at 15:48`.
