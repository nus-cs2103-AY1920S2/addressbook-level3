== Introduction

=== Software Overview

FoodieBot is a campus food application which can help users look for food they want, by recommending the canteens nearest to them,
providing randomized food suggestions, helping users plan their budget and provide info on food around
NUS.
FoodieBot is the one stop application to solve all meal decision problems on NUS.

=== Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe the architecture and system design of the FoodieBot. This documentation is for anyone who
wishes to understand more about FoodieBot and how it works.

=== Audience

Our target users are students, staff and tourists, in general anyone who comes to or visits NUS.
In particular, for the indecisive user, this application can give a random food suggestion tailored to each user based on their budget and/ or past food selections etcetera.

== Setting up
Our application is being managed by the dependency management tool Gradle.
The project is available at https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F11-3/main. After cloning the repository, you can follow these steps:

For IntelliJ users

1. Run gradle build.
2. Run gradle run.

== Definitions

Defined below are common terminology that will be used frequently throughout this document.

[BLUE]#Context#::
Refers to which state the application is in. Use interchangeably with user interface.

== Design
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `favorites set 1`.

.Component interactions for `favorites set 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CanteenListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `FoodieBotParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.


NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the FoodieBot data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Canteen>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `FoodieBot`, which `Canteen` can reference. This would allow `FoodieBot` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Canteen` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/foodiebot/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the FoodieBot data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.foodiebot.commons` package.


=== Design Considerations
==== Aspect: Executing similar tasks but for different objects

e.g. Selecting canteens, stalls, food.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a context class that
executes commands based on the context the user is in.
** Pros: Higher quality user interface, user does not need to remember
so many commands.
** Cons: More difficult to implement.

* Alternative 2: Create different commands for different objects
** Pros: Easier to implement. There will not be any chance
of overlapping commands
** Cons: Reduce quality of user interface as user has to remember many
different commands.


== Implementation

=== [Proposed] List feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The list command is facilitated by `ListCommandParser`.
It extends `FoodieBotParser` to handle list canteen commands.
It implements the following operations:

* `ListCommand#execute()` -- Updates the canteen list to show all the canteens or filtered by location.

[NOTE]
`ListCommand` extends `Command` with `Command#execute()`.

* `ListCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` -- Checks if the prefixes specified in `parse()` are found in the command entered by the user.
* `ListCommandParser#parse()` -- Identifies if prefixes have been specified and handles them respectively. +
For example, if ListCommand has the nearest block name passed through as a parameter `list f\com1`, ListCommand will filter the canteen list with the given block name with `new ListCommand("com1")`

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:


image::ListSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a list command:


image::ListActivityDiagram.png[]


==== List Design Considerations
===== Aspect: User command format

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `list f/com`
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: `f/` is an optional prefix, user might forget that it exists as no error is shown in the command result box
* **Alternative 2:** find nearest `BLOCK_NAME`
** Pros: The user finds it natural to type the word find.
** Cons: Can be confusing whether find shows the list of canteens, food, or location of the canteen on campus. Having the 'find' command is also one additional command for the user to remember.

=== Budget Command

The `budget` command is implemented by the `BudgetCommand` class.

This command is accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to set the budget for the user or to view the current budget of the user.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrate the different scenario for the budge command:

//image::

==== Budget Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `BudgetCommandParse` object.
. `BudgetCommandParse` then parse the budget command to determine if the action of the budget is `set`, `view` or invalid. +
This process returns a new `BudgetCommand` object.
. The `LogicManager` then access then `BudgetCommand#execute()` to determine the type of execution.
. If the action is `set` then the `budget` object saves the user input accordingly.
. If the action is `view` then the budge is retrieve from the storage.
. The `BudgetCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `budget` command:

//image::

==== Budget Design Considerations
===== Aspect:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `
** Pros:
** Cons:
* **Alternative 2:**
** Pros:

=== Enter Command

The `enter` command is implemented by either the `EnterCanteenCommand` class or the `EnterStallCommand` class.

These commands are accessed by the `LogicManager#execute()` to switch the user interface accordingly base on where the user is at.

The following _activity diagram_ illustrates the different scenario for the enter command:

//image::

==== Enter Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` which parses the user input into a `ParserContext` to determine if the user is currently on the main context.
. If the user has input `enter` on the main context, it creates a `EnterCanteenCommandParser` object that parses in the user input to determine which canteen to enter.
. Otherwise if the user has Input `enter` on the stall context, it creates a `EnterStallCommandParser` object that parses in the user input to determine which stall to enter
This process returns a new `EnterCanteenCommand` */* `EnterStallCommand` object accordingly to the `LogicManager`.
. The `LogicManager` then access `EnterCanteenCommand#execute()` */* `EnterStallCommand#execute()` to switch the current display to the stalls/food available within the selected canteen/stall.
. Both `EnterCanteenCommand#execute()` and `EnterStallCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` object to the `LogicManger`.

Below is the _activity diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `enter` command:

//image::

==== Favorites Command Implementation

. The `LogicManager` first executes `FoodieBotParser` to create a `FavoritesCommandParser` object.
. `FavoritesCommandParser` then parse the user input to determine if the favorite command is `set`, `remove`, or `view`.
This process returns a new `FavoritesCommand` object.
. The `LogicManager` then access `FavoritesCommand#execute()`.
. If `set` was chosen, the selected food item favorite is then updated.
. If `view` was chosen, a list of favorite food items are displayed.
. If `remove` was chosen, the respective food item is remove from the favorite food item list.
. `FavoritesCommand#execute()` creates a new `ActionCommandResult` that extends the `CommandResult` which is to be returned
to the `LogicManager`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `favorites` command:

//image::

. The `LogicManager` then access `FilterCommand#execute()` which filter the options based on the user input and the context where `filter` is called.
. If the filter option is based on a price, the current context has to be the stall, otherwise an error message is thrown.
. If the option is based on a tag, the filter option will return a list of option base on the current context.
. `FilterCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`.

Below is the _sequence diagram_ that summarizes what happens during the execution of the `filter` command:
