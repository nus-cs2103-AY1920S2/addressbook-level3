== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a client).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Client` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Command History

This feature allows users to save their previously entered commands and to retrieve them using the "up" and "down" arrow keys, similar to what most modern CLIs offer.

==== Implementation

This command history mechanism is facilitated by the model `CommandHistory`, and the storage code in `CommandHistoryStorage`. The behaviour of this feature mimics most modern CLIs, namely:

* The empty string, `""`, will not be stored in the history
* Commands that are similar to the most recently stored command in the history will not be stored (ie. duplicate commands will not be stored)
* All other user input, be it valid or invalid commands, will be stored
* There is a maximum size of the stored history (100 in this case, for performance reasons discussed in the later section)
* Pressing the "up" arrow key will browse backwards towards the least recently entered commands
* Pressing the "down" arrow key will browse forwards towards the most recently entered commands
* The caret position must be at the end of the command when browsing the history
* Persistent storage of the command history is supported (ie. a user can quit the app and come back to the same history as his previous usage of the app)

Since all entered user inputs should be stored, be it valid or invalid commands, and since detection of the "up" and "down" arrow keys must occur in the `CommandBox` class found in the UI, we have decided to let `CommandBox` directly interact with `CommandHistory`. In other words, `CommandBox` will call `CommandHistory#add`, `CommandHistory#getNextCommand`, and `CommandHistory#getPrevCommand`. A simplified class diagram of the classes involved in this feature is given below:

image::CommandHistoryClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

In designing this feature, we had to decide on the underlying data structure to store the command history. Currently, each line of command is stored in an `ArrayList<String>`. The alternative is to store the commands in a `LinkedList<String>`.

[options='header']
|====================
| Data Structure | Pros and Cons
| Array list |
*Pros*: Much easier to manipulate using indices

*Cons*: Slower performance when list has the maximum number of commands stored and has to shift all indices back by 1 when removing the oldest command
| Linked list |
*Pros*: Fast removal of the oldest command

*Cons*: Harder to implement as pointers have to be manipulated
|====================

In the interest of saving developement time and better code readability, we decided to use an array list to store the commands. Since we have capped the maximum size of history to be 100, we found out through testing that this causes no observable nor significant lag when the list reaches the maximum capacity and has to reassign all 100 indices.

Moreover, the implementation of `CommandHistoryStorage#saveCommandHistory` will rewrite the whole data file in storage (as opposed to appending the file with the newly entered command). This decision was made to protect the integrity of the storage file, making sure that it always has the exact same data as what is stored in the `CommandHistory` model. As such, this rewriting of the file during maximum capacity of the history will be the bigger bottleneck in term of performance, as opposed to the reassignment of indices.

As such, the choice of 100 as the maximum size of the command history is thus chosen. This number must be small enough to not cause the app to lag when the whole history is being written to storage, as well as be big enough to satisfy the user. Ultimately, we felt that 100 is a very generous estimate given that a user really only needs the past few commands at any point of time.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Storage of Clients and Exercises

This section explains the implementation and design considerations for storage of clients and exercises.

==== Implementation

We have decided to store the exercises done by the client together with the same client in one JSON file. Each `JsonAdaptedClient` will have a list of `JsonAdaptedExercise`.

image::ClientExerciseStorageClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

While implementing the storage for clients and exercises, we had multiple choices. We decided to save the exercises together with the client who did them. All the clients will then be stored in one JSON file.

[options='header']
|====================
| Considerations | Pros and Cons
| Store exercises with client and all clients in one JSON file |
*Pros*: Much easier to link the exercises to the client during reading and storing

*Cons*: Might have one large JSON file and potentially exceed the size limit of a JSON file
| Store all exercises into a separate JSON file |
*Pros*: Keep exercise data separate from client data

*Cons*: Hard to link the exercises to the client during reading and storing

| Store exercises with client but one JSON for each client |
*Pros*: Low chances of exceeding the size limit of a JSON file

*Cons*: Might have too many JSON files for each client +
Tough to identify which JSON file is for which client
|====================

We decided to use the first approach of storing the exercises with the client and all clients in one JSON file. There are multiple reasons for our choice as mentioned below.

We want to keep the implementation reading and storing of data simple. The first approach is  the most simple. When reading the data, it will remove the need to associate the exercises to the client. A client might potentially have a large amount of exercises, resulting in the reading process to be extremely slow.

Moreover, storing the exercise data from client data does not provide any performance benefits. Due to time constraints, we decided that the application should store all the data everytime it closes. This is regardless if the particular exercise or client data has been changed. Having to keep track of which data is edited and only overwrite those data would greatly increase the complexity of the application. Therefore, keeping exercises data separate from client data would be unnecessary and provide little additional functionality to the user.

Lastly, we foresee that it is improbable for the data size of both clients and exercises to exceed the maximum size limit of a JSON file. With the target user in mind, it is unlikely that he will have an enormous amount of clients as he have to cater time for each of them. Even though each client might have many exercises, the information of each exercise is relatively small.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
