== Introduction

Welcome to *MODdy's Developer Guide*! This document is to help you understand the implementation of MODdy and its features better.

[TIP]
Feel free to open an issue in our link:{repoURL}/issues[issue tracker] if you have any questions, features suggestion or bugs to report.

== Setting up
This is a guide on how to set up MODdy as a project on your computer.

Refer to the guide link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/SettingUp.adoc[here].

== Design
This section describes some noteworthy details on how different components in MODdy work together.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-3/main/blob/master/docs/UsingPlantUml.adoc[Using PlantUML guide] to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The high-level _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/John`.

.Component interactions for `delete n/John` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts namely `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ProfileListPanel`, `DeadlineListPanel`,
 `CoursePanel`, `FocusAreaPanel`, `IndividualModulePanel`, `OverviewPanel`, `ModuleListPanel`, `WelcomeView`, `HelpWindow` and `StatusBarFooter`.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The following panels are made up of one or more parts. For example,

* `ProfileListPanel` consists of `ProfileCard`,
* `DeadlinePanel` consists of `DeadlineCard`,
* `OverviewPanel` consists of `ProfileCard` and `OverviewModuleCard`,
* `ModuleListPanel` consists of `ModuleCard`,
* `FocusAreaPanel` consists of `ModuleCard`,
* `CoursePanel` consists of `CourseFocusAreaCard` and `CourseRequirementCard`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
// end::ui[]

// tag::logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ModdyParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a `Module`).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete m/CS2101 t/work")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete m/CS2101 t/work` Command
image::DeleteDeadlineLogicDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
// end::logic[]
// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="400"]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the profile data.
* stores a `ModuleList` of modules taken in each semester in a `HashMap`
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Deadline>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
// end::model[]

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="500"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The Storage component consists of the following three main parts:

. Profiles: `JsonProfileListStorage` handles reading and saving of profiles from JSON to `Profile` objects and vice versa. The `Profile` objects are stored in a `ProfileList`.
. Modules: `JsonModuleListStorage` handles only reading of modules from JSON to `Module` objects, which are stored in a `ModuleList`.
. Courses: `JsonCourseListStorage` handles only reading of courses from JSON to `Course` objects, which are stored in a `CourseList`.

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in JSON format and read it back.
* can save the Profile List data in JSON format and read it back as a `ProfileList` object.
* can read Module List data from JSON format to a `ModuleList` object.
* can read Course List data from JSON format to a `CourseList` object.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::dependency[]
=== Dependency between Module and Personal
.Structure of the Module Component
image::ModuleClassDiagram.png[]

Each `Module` class consists of a `Personal` class, alongside other module attributes from NUSMODS. In each `Personal` class, there are 3 attributes that are for the user to store their data: +

* `Grade` : the user's grade for the particular module
* `Status` : the status of the module (COMPLETED, IN_PROGRESS, PLANNING)
* `DeadlineList` : a list of `Deadline` tasks added by the user

These attributes were included in `Personal` as they are the attributes that are personal to the user, and which the user can edit at any time.
`ModuleGrade` and `ModuleStatus` are enumeration classes that store valid grades and module statuses.
//end::dependency[]

// tag::command[]
=== Structure of Command Features

The `Command` features in MODdy all extends from a single abstract class `Command`. A specific `Command` object created is executed by the `LogicManger` using the respective `Parser`, which then returns a `CommandResult` object and provides the result of that `Command` feature. +

The following class diagram shows the implementation of MODdy's `Command` features:

.Class diagram illustrating all classes extending from `Command`
image::CommandClassDiagram.png[]

The sections below gives more details on each `Command` feature.
// end::command[]

// tag::new[]
=== New Profile Feature
The `new` feature allows the user to create a `Profile` with the command `new`, appended with the tags.

The tags are:

* `n/name` for `Name`
* `c/course` for `Course`
* `y/currentYear.currentSemester` for current year and semester
* `f/focusArea` for `FocusArea`

==== Current Implementations

`NewCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `NewCommand` is parsed using `NewCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `new` operation works with the input: `new n/John c/Computer Science y/2.2`.

.Interactions between UI, Logic and Model components for `new n/John c/Computer Science y/2.2` command
image::NewCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Use the `y/year.semester` tag like all other commands
** Pros: More intuitive for user (only one tag related to year and semester).
** Cons: Harder to convey the idea that it has to be *current* year and *current* semester to user.

* *Alternative 2:* Have an additional tag `cs/currentYear.currentSemester` instead of `y/year.semester` to identify the year and semester user is in
** Pros: Easier to differentiate the current year and semester user is in among all `y/year.semester` tags.
** Cons: More tags to parse, and also less intuitive for user (have to use both `cs/` and `y/`).

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 to prioritize user-friendliness and cleaner code.
// end::new[]

// tag::add[]
=== Add Module / Task Feature

The `add` feature allows the user to add a `Module` and a `Task` with a `Deadline` for an existing module with the command `add`, appended with the tags.

The tags are:

* `m/moduleCode y/year.semester [g/grade]` for adding a module
* `m/moduleCode y/year.semester t/task [d/deadline]` for adding a task to an existing module

[NOTE]
Multiple modules can be added at once but only to the *same year and semester*, e.g. `add m/CS1231 m/IS1103 m/MA1521 y/1.1`. +
Multiple tasks can be added at once but only to the *same module*, e.g. `add m/CS1231 t/tutorial d/2020-04-20 18:00 t/assignment d/2020-04-25 23:59`. +
[NOTE]
`g/grade` is optional. +
However, grades cannot be added when adding multiple modules.
[NOTE]
`d/deadline` is optional. +
However, for multiple tasks, as long as one `Task` has a `Deadline`, all `t/task` tags have to be appended with `d/deadline` tags. For the tasks with no deadlines, the tag can just be `d/`.

==== Current Implementations

`AddCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `AddCommand` is parsed using `AddCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` operation works with input: `add m/CS2105 y/2.2`.

.Interactions between Ui, Logic and Model components for `add m/CS2105 y/2.2` command
image::AddSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect 1: How modules are added*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Add multiple `Module` objects with one `AddCommand`
** Pros: More convenient for the user.
** Cons: Inconsistent with other commands, which can only take in one similar object with one `Command`.

* *Alternative 2:* Add only one `Module` object with one `AddCommand`
** Pros: Easier to implement and consistent across all commands.
** Cons: More to type if user intends to add multiple `Module` objects.

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 for the convenience of the user since the number of modules taken per semester is not low.

*Aspect 2: How `Deadline` feature is implemented*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* The `date` is compulsory while `time` is optional for a `deadline`
** Pros: Gives user the flexibility to input different types of tasks.
** Cons: More bugs in `deadline` related method calls.

* *Alternative 2:* Both `date` and `time` is compulsory for a `deadline`
** Pros: Easier to implement since both date and time will be parsed.
** Cons: Some tasks do not have a timing that it must be completed by, making it not user-friendly.


Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 for the benefits of the user. To tackle the cons, we have set `time` to be "23:59" by default if user did not specify.
// end::add[]

// tag::edit[]

=== Edit Profile / Module Feature

The `edit` feature supports the editing of both `Profile` and `Module`. `Profile` is edited with the command `edit` and `Module` is edited with the command `edit` appended with `m/moduleCode`. +

The edit profile feature is a complementary feature to the new profile feature. It allows the user to edit their profile that was created at the start. Profile features such as name, course, current year/semester and focus area can be edited using this command. +

In addition, the edit module feature is a complementary feature to the add module feature. It allows the user to edit a module that has previously been added. The user can edit module information such as the semester it is taken and grade. +

Lastly, the edit deadline feature is a complementary feature to the add deadline feature. It allows the user to edit a deadline that has previously been added to a module. The user can edit deadline information such as its description, date and time. +

To edit the profile, the command `edit` should be appended with one or more of the tags:

* `n/name` : New name
* `c/course` : New course
* `y/year.semester` : New current year/semester
* `f/focusArea` : New focus area

To edit a module, the command `edit` should be appended with `m/moduleCode`, followed by one or more of the tags:

* `y/year.semester` : New year/semester where module is taken
* `g/grade` : New grade for the module
* `t/task` : Old task description
** `nt/newTask` : New task description
** `d/deadline` : New date and time

To edit a deadline that has previously been added, append `edit m/moduleCode` with `t/task` which is the description of the task to be edited, followed by either `nt/newTask` which is the new description of the task and/or `d/deadline` which is the new  deadline that will replace the existing one.

==== Current Implementations
`EditCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `EditCommannd` is parsed using `EditCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.


The following sequence diagram shows how the `edit` command works: `edit n/John`:

.Interactions between UI, Logic and Model components for the `edit n/John` Command
image::EditSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Edit `Profile`, `Module` or `Deadline`  with one `EditCommand`
** Pros: Easier for the user as they will not have to remember different edit commands for different purposes.
** Cons: More considerations to differentiate the intent of the user and there is more room for error.

* *Alternative 2:* Have separate commands to edit `Profile`, `Module` and `Deadline`
** Pros: Makes it clearer what the user intent is and is easier to parse.
** Cons: Harder for the user to remember the commands and the user will not be allowed to edit both module details and deadline tasks within the module at the same time.

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 due to the benefits of consistency. Additionally, by requiring a `m/moduleCode` field for the user to edit `Module`, it clearly shows the intent of the user, and whether the `Profile` or a `Module` should be edited.

We also considered whether to allow users to edit the grade of a module that has yet to be taken. We eventually decided to allow that as many students may want to predict their <<CAP, CAP>>, which our CAP calculator will allow them to do.

The following activity diagram shows how the `edit` command decides what to edit (profile, module details or deadline task):

.Activity Diagram for an Edit Command input
image::EditCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

// end::edit[]

// tag::show[]
=== Show Profile / Module / Semester / Course / Focus Area Feature

The `show` feature allows the user to display information about a `Profile`, `Module`, `Course`, `FocusArea` or `Semester` with the command `show`, appended with the tags below. These information cannot be seen from the main UI and have to be displayed through the `show` command.

The tags are:

* `n/name` for `Profile`
* `m/moduleCode` for `Module`
* `c/course` for `Course`
* `f/focusArea` for `FocusArea`
* `y/year.semester` for `Semester`

==== Current Implementations

`ShowCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `ShowCommand` is parsed using `ShowCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `show` command works: `show n/John`

.Interactions between UI, Logic and Model components for `show n/John` command
image::ShowSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following activity diagram shows how the `show` operation works with input: `show c/Computer Science`

.Activity Diagram for a Show Command input
image::ShowCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

NOTE: If more than one accepted tag is given, such as `show c/Computer Science m/CS1101s`, MODdy will not display anything and will instead give the user a message that only one tag should be provided.


==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Have one `ShowCommand` for all objects to be displayed
** Pros: Repeated code is avoided
** Cons: Takes in an `Object` in its constructor, any `Object` can call this method and cause unintended usages

* *Alternative 2:* Have a separate `ShowCommand` (e.g. `ShowModuleCommand`, `ShowCourseCommand`) for each object shown
** Pros: Applies Single Level of Abstraction Principle (SLAP)
** Cons: Too many classes having repeated code

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 due to the benefits of avoiding repeated code. To tackle the cons from this, we implemented guard conditions to gracefully reject other objects that may unintentionally call this method.
// end::show[]

// tag::delete[]

=== Delete Profile / Module / Task / Grade Feature

The `delete` feature allows the user to delete a `Profile`, `Module`, `Task` or `Grade` with the command `delete`, appended with the tags.

The tags are:

* `n/name` for deleting a `Profile`
* `m/moduleCode` for deleting a `Module`
* `m/moduleCode t/task` for deleting a `Task`
* `m/moduleCode g/` for deleting a `Grade`

[NOTE]
Multiple modules can be deleted at once, e.g. `delete m/CS1231 m/IS1103 m/MA1521`. +
Multiple tasks can be deleted at once but only from the *same module*, e.g. `delete m/CS1231 t/task t/exam`. +
Multiple grades can be deleted at once, e.g. `delete m/CS1231 m/IS1103 m/MA1521 g/`.

==== Current Implementations

`DeleteCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation. `DeleteCommand` is parsed using `DeleteCommandParser` to split the user input into relevant fields.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete` operation works with input: `delete m/CS2101 t/work`

.Interactions between UI, Logic and Model components for the `delete m/CS2101 t/work` command.

The following activity diagram shows how the `show` command decides what to show (profile, module details, semester, course, module or focus area):

.Activity Diagram for a Delete Command input
image::DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Delete multiple `Module` or `Task` objects with one `DeleteCommand`
** Pros: More convenient for users.
** Cons: Inconsistent with deleting a `Profile`, which can only take in at most one `Profile`.

* *Alternative 2:* Delete only one `Module` or `Task` object with one `DeleteCommand`
** Pros: Easier to implement and consistent with deleting `Profile`.
** Cons: More to type if user intends to delete multiple `Module` objects or `Task` objects.

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 to provide more convenience and flexibility to users.
// end::delete[]

// tag::help[]
=== Help Feature
The `help` feature allows the user to view the pop-up `HelpWindow` with the command `help`. This feature allows the user to have a
quick view of sample inputs if they run into trouble while using the application.

==== Current Implementations

`HelpCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation.

==== Design Considerations

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* `HelpWindow` exists as a pop-up window
** Pros: Easier for user to refer to while typing different commands in the `CommandBox` in `MainWindow`.
** Cons: As it exists as a separate window, it might cause hindrance for user when use MODdy.

* *Alternative 2:* `HelpWindow` appears in `MainWindow`
** Pros: Integral with the whole `MainWindow`.
** Cons: The `HelpWindow` might be replaced by user input command, and user would have to enter `help` command again to view the `HelpWindow`.

Eventually, we decided on alternative 1 due to the benefits of allowing user to cross-reference the commands while using the application.
// end::help[]

// tag::home[]
=== Home Feature
The `home` feature allows the user to return to the homepage.

==== Current Implementations

`HomeCommand` extends from the `Command` class and uses the inheritance to facilitate the implementation.

// end::home[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Effort

In this section, we highlight the amount of effort took for us to develop MODdy, the challenges faced in this development and our eventual achievement.

=== Overall effort

Estimated effort: 16

The above estimated effort uses Address Book 3 (AB3) as a base estimation of 10 for effort taken.

In short, AB3 essentially stores data related to multiple persons. MODdy does that for one, but does much more. MODdy is able to store data for a user such as their course, focus areas and personal information of their modules, be it in the past, present or future.

There was a considerable amount of time spent throughout the construction of MODdy. We had to figure out how different courses and modules could be linked to each other in MODdy. We also had to plan out features that could allow users to make this course and module management application more personal. Features were not just implemented immediately, but significant considerations were taken to decide whether it was consistent with the other features that MODdy offered.

Feature implementation was also not just a single point of discussion. New features required edits to other features to maintain consistency, while some required even newer features to complement it. All these discussions were held at least once a week for a minimum of 2 hours each round to ensure that we were in sync with each others' work.

However, we also understand that AB3 has certain code classes that are complicated to build and these classes were also reused in MODdy. Examples of these reused classes are found in the `commons` package, while MODdy-specific classes such as `JsonSerializableCourseList`, `JsonCourseListStorage` and `JsonCourse` were implemented with heavy reference to original AB3 classes. Hence, the estimated effort was scaled back slightly.

=== Challenges faced

Ultimately, the biggest challenge was getting the User Interface (UI) of MODdy to be exactly as we envisioned. This UI was new and completely different from the existing AB3 UI, and this meant that we had to write entirely new code in an area which we were unfamiliar with. As a group of relatively inexperienced programmers, our prior application-building experiences were mostly limited to command-line interface applications. As such, implementing MODdy without any points of reference posed a huge challenge.

Another challenge was having to overcome issues and bugs that our new features brought. Manual testing took a significant amount of time, ensuring positive tests worked as they should, while we also had to design extensive negative tests to cover as many situations of undesired input as we could.

=== Achievements

MODdy turned out to be the best version of the MODdy that we had planned for in the first place. Initially, we scaled back on the number of features due to the difficulties faced during implementation, for fear of a lack of time. However, we were able to scale back up our efforts after overcoming difficulties and bugs faced, to bring back the initially planned features.

We are satisfied with the latest release version of MODdy as it is able to perform what we wanted it to do in the first place, to be a one-stop application for personal course and module management in NUS.
