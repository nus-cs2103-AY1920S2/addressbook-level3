== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a client).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Client` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Command History --- Aaron Choo

This feature allows users to save their previously entered commands and to retrieve them using the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow keys, similar to what most modern CLIs offer.

==== Implementation

This command history mechanism is facilitated by the logic class `CommandHistory`, which controls both the model `CommandHistoryState` and the storage `CommandHistoryStorage`. The behaviour has been implemented to mimic most modern CLIs, namely:

. The empty string, `""`, should not be stored in the history
. Commands that are similar to the most recently stored command in the history should not be stored (ie. duplicate commands will not be stored)
. All other user input, be it valid or invalid commands, should be stored
. Number of commands should only be stored up to a well-defined maximum number (100 in this case, for performance reasons discussed in the later section)
. Pressing the kbd:[Up] arrow key should browse backwards towards the least recently entered commands
. Pressing the kbd:[Down] arrow key should browse forwards towards the most recently entered commands
. The caret position should be at the end of the command string when browsing the history
. Persistent storage of the command history should be supported (ie. a user can quit the app and come back to the same history as his previous usage of the app)

Since all user inputs, be it valid or invalid commands, should be stored, and since detection of the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow keys must occur in the `CommandBox` class found in the UI, we have decided to let `CommandBox` directly interact with `CommandHistory`. In other words, `CommandBox` will be responsible for calling `CommandHistory#addToHistory`, `CommandHistory#getNextCommand`, and `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommand`. A simplified class diagram of the classes involved in this feature is given below:

image::CommandHistoryClassDiagram.png[]

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution for when the user decides to enter the command `list-c` into FitBiz:

image::CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

In designing the model `CommandHistoryState`, we had to decide on the underlying data structure to store the command history. We currently use an `ArrayList<String>`, where each line of command is stored as an individual entry. Another alternative that we have considered is to store the commands in a `LinkedList<String>`.

[options='header']
|====================
| Data Structure | Pros and Cons
| Array list |
*Pros*: Much easier to manipulate using indices

*Cons*: Slower performance when list has the maximum number of commands stored and has to shift all indices back by 1 when removing the oldest command
| Linked list |
*Pros*: Fast removal of the oldest command

*Cons*: Harder to implement as pointers have to be manipulated
|====================

In the interest of saving developement time and better code readability, we decided to use an array list to store the commands. Since we have capped the maximum size of history to be 100, there is a need to remove the first item (or the zeroth index) from the list to free up space. Of course, doing a `remove(0)` on a 100-item array list will require that all 99 remaining items in the list be reassigned to new indices. However, we found out through extensive testing that this causes no observable nor significant lag when the maximum capacity of 100 items is reached and this happens.

Moreover, the implementation of `CommandHistoryStorage#saveCommandHistory` will rewrite the whole data file in storage (as opposed to appending the file with the newly entered command). This decision was made to protect the integrity of the storage file, making sure that it always has the exact same data as what is stored in the `CommandHistory` model. As such, this rewriting of the file during the maximum capacity of the array list will be the bigger bottleneck in terms of performance, as opposed to the reassignment of indices.

As such, the choice of 100 as the maximum size of the command history is thus chosen. This number must be small enough to not cause the app to lag when the whole history is being written to storage, as well as be big enough to satisfy the user. Ultimately, we felt that 100 is a very generous estimate given that a user really only needs the past few commands at any point of time.

=== Scheduling for a Client --- Ng Ming Liang
This feature allows for a user to assign a weekly schedule to a client. Timings are represented in the 24-hour format `HHmm`. Each client can have none or multiple schedules that do not have overlapping timings. Multiple clients are allowed to have overlapping timings with each other.

==== Implementation
This scheduling mechanism is facilitated by `ScheduleList`, which is a wrapper class for an `ArrayList` of `Schedule` objects. Each `Client` contains one `ScheduleList` attribute to keep track of all `Schedule` assigned to it. If there are no assigned `Schedule` for the `Client`, then the `ScheduleList` contains an empty `ArrayList` of `Schedule`.

`Schedule` comprises three attributes:

* `Day`

* `StartTime`

* `EndTime`

`Day` wraps the enum `DayEnum.Weekday` and represents the day of the week the schedule takes place on.
`StartTime` and `EndTime` represent the start time and end time of the schedule in the "HHmm" format respectively. The relations between these classes are shown in the class diagram below.

image::ScheduleClassDiagram.png[]

These attributes are bounded by these characteristics:

* Each `Client` can only contain unique `Schedule`, that is, there are no overlaps in timings between any two `Schedule` in the `ScheduleList`. This is ensured by `ScheduleCommandParser#checkIfOverlaps()`

* Overlapping timings between the `Schedule` of different `Client` is allowed

* The maximum timeframe between `StartTime` and `EndTime` is from `0000` to `2359`

* `StartTime` cannot be later than `EndTime`

* `Day` can only take up the 7 values of the week (MON/TUE/WED/THU/FRI/SAT/SUN)

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution for when the user decides to enter the command `schedule 1 day/mon st/1100 et/1200` into FitBiz:

image::ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png[]



==== Design Considerations
In designing this feature, we had to consider the alternative ways in which we can choose to store the information of a schedule. One option of storing the relevant information (day, start, end times) for a schedule was simply to concatenate these values into a single String, for example, `"monday-1100-1200"`. However, we found that this did not exploit the desirable principles of Object-Oriented Programming. As respective sanity checks had to be done for the day
and timing, wrapping each of these properties into their wrapper classes allowed for better modularity and organisation of these attributes. For example, `Day#isValidDay` handles the validation of the input for day and `Time#isValidTimingFormat` handles the validation of time.

Considerations also then had to be made for how to contain multiple `Schedule`. The current implementation uses the `ArrayList` data structure to hold multiple `Schedule`. Other considered alternative for `ScheduleList` was `HashSet`.
[options='header']
|====================
| Data Structure | Pros and Cons
| ArrayList |
*Pros*: Elements can be sorted and retrieved in ascending order

*Cons*: Does not ensure that its elements are unique
| HashSet |
*Pros*: Does not allow duplicate values

*Cons*: Does not return elements in order
|====================

As the nature of the schedule panel was to display a sorted collection of `Schedule`, we chose `ArrayList` as the underlying data structure. In addition, we also harnessed the capability of the `HashSet` to ensure no overlaps between `Schedule` within each `Client`, which is implemented by `ScheduleCommandParser#checkIfOverlaps`.

=== Command Autocompletion --- Aaron Choo

Similar to the previously mentioned "Command History" feature, this feature improves the user experience by allowing users to press the kbd:[Tab] key to autocomplete their partially entered commands.

==== Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the logic found in the `AutoComplete` class. Before we dive into the implementation, let us first define what _unambiguous_ and _ambiguous_ commands are. Unambiguous commands are those that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of letters that the user has entered. Ambiguous commands are those that cannot be identified by the said sequence of letters. For example, assume we only have 3 commands in our app, `add-c`, `add-e`, and `edit-c`. If the user enters `e` and presses kbd:[Tab], we say that this is an unambiguous command since clearly only `edit-c` can be the correct command. If instead, the user enters `a` and presses kbd:[Tab], we say that this is an ambiguous command, since both `add-c` and `add-e` are possible choices. Again, let us start by defining the behaviour (which also has been implemented to mimic most modern CLIs):

. The caret position should be at the end of the line after any successful autocompletion of commands
. Any unambiguous commands should be completed upon pressing of the kbd:[Tab] key
. Any ambiguous commands should be completed up till the longest common prefix of all similar commands
** Using the ambiguous command example in the introduction above, when the user enters `a` and presses kbd:[Tab], the autocompletion should return `add-` to the user
. A list of all similar commands should be presented to the user should he try to autocomplete an ambiguous command

A limitation of the current design is that we are only able to autocomplete _commands_, and not other fields/parameters like names and addresses that have been used by the user before. As such, since all commands defined in FitBiz do not have empty spaces in them, this allows us to easily determine when to disable this feature (ie. when the user has already completed the command and has moved on to entering the parameters). As such, the following code snippet is used in `AutoComplete#execute` to stop trying to autocomplete if white spaces has been detected:

```java
if (currCommand.contains(WHITE_SPACE_STRING)) {
      return;
}
```

Similarly, since this feature relies heavily on the UI `CommandBox`, we have decided to let `CommandBox` interact with `AutoComplete` directly. `AutoComplete` makes use of the `Trie` data structure which we will discuss in the next section. As such, the following simplified class diagram shows exactly which classes are responsible for this feature:

image::CommandAutocompleteClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

For the implementation of this feature, we have decided to use a Trie data structure. Since no such data structure exists natively in Java, we had to implement our own version of it. Of course, we have also considered other much simpler alternatives like simply storing all available commands in a `List`. A quick summary of the pros and cons is given here:

[options='header']
|====================
| Data Structure | Pros and Cons
| Trie |
*Pros*: Searching is relatively inexpensive, and handles behaviour number 3 discussed above efficiently

*Cons*: Harder initial development of this data structure
| List |
*Pros*: Fast initial development

*Cons*: Searching is computationally expensive; does not scale well with the app as the list of commands grow
|====================

As such, the choice of implementing our own Trie data structure is obvious. Exchanging some initial development time for future scalability of our app will ensure that we, or future developers, do not end up wasting time refactoring what could have been done in the first place. Moreover, as mentioned, the Trie data structure is effective and computationally inexpensive in finding the longest common prefix of all ambiguous commands. The same cannot be said when using just a list.

Also, since we have implemented our own Trie data structure, it would also allow more custom logic to be added later, and allow more creative freedom with respect to the features that future developers would want to add.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Exercise Feature --- Yong Jie

The function of recording the clients' exercises is one of the main features of our application. This section provides its key implementation details.

==== Implementation

===== Exercise class

We implemented the `Exercise` class to contain the details of the exercise. An example would be the use of `ExerciseWeight` class to represent the weight of the exercise. Below shows a UML class diagram which provides further understanding of `Exercise`.

image::ExerciseClassDiagram.png[]

===== Exercise Commands

Currently, there are only 2 exercise commands. The `add-e` command adds an exercise to the client and the `delete-e` command deletes an exercise from a client. The commands follow a similar execution flow as other commands.

For the `add-e` command, we had to pay particular attention to the index where new Exercise is added. This is such that the exercises for the client will be displayed in descending chronological order in the table after a `view-c` command. `TableView` provides sorting for dates. However, having `TableView` to do the sorting would result in mismatch of indexes of the exercises in the `UniqueExerciseList` and in the `TableView`. This would result in problems when using `delete-e` command as it deletes the exercise at the specified index.

We will use an example of a `add-e` command to illustrate the program execution flow. Consider an instance where user inputs `add-e n/pushup d/12-12-2011 reps/20`. The `AddressBookParser` will create a `AddExerciseCommandParser`. By using `ParserUtil`, `AddExerciseCommandParser` will extract details like the reps of the exercise and pass the arguments to `AddExerciseCommand`. The sequence diagram below shows the execution flow when the AddExerciseCommand is executed. Details of exception thrown are omitted as this is a postive instance and for simplicity.

image::AddExerciseCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

`AddExerciseCommand` checks if there is an client being viewed. For this instance, we will consider the positive case where indeed there is a client being viewed. `AddExerciseCommand` will retrieve the client being viewed from the `Model` so that details like the existing exercise list of the client can be obtained. The sequence diagram illustrates the execution flow of how the new exercise, `toAdd`, is added to the exercise list.

image::AddExerciseCommandSequenceDiagramPart2.png[]

The exercise list, `UniqueExerciseList`, will go through a loop and iterate through the exercises in the list. The date of each exercise will be compared with the date of the `toAdd` exercise. `toAdd` will then be added to the `UniqueExerciseList` at the index to keep the list sorted.

==== Design Considerations

This section explains the our design considerations and analysis for the storage of exercises.

[options='header']
|====================
| Considerations | Pros and Cons
| Store exercises with client and all clients in one JSON file |
*Pros*: Much easier to link the exercises to the client during reading and storing

*Cons*: Might have one large JSON file and potentially exceed the size limit of a JSON file
| Store all exercises into a separate JSON file |
*Pros*: Keep exercise data separate from client data

*Cons*: Hard to link the exercises to the client during reading and storing

| Store exercises with client but one JSON for each client |
*Pros*: Low chances of exceeding the size limit of a JSON file

*Cons*: Might have too many JSON files for each client +
Tough to identify which JSON file is for which client
|====================

We decided to use the first approach of storing the exercises with the associated client and have all the clients data in one JSON file. By code wise, each `JsonAdaptedClient` will have a list of `JsonAdaptedExercise`.

image::ClientExerciseStorageClassDiagram.png[]

We want to keep the implementation reading and storing of data simple. The first approach is  the most simple. When reading the data, it removes the need to associate the exercises to the client. A client might potentially have a large amount of exercises, resulting in the reading process to be extremely slow.

Moreover, storing the exercise data from client data does not provide any performance benefits. Due to time constraints, we decided that the application should store all the data everytime it closes. This is regardless if the particular exercise or client data has been changed. Having to keep track of which data is edited and only overwrite those data would greatly increase the complexity of the application. Therefore, keeping exercises data separate from client data would be unnecessary and provide little additional functionality/benefits to the user.

Lastly, we foresee that it is improbable for the data size of both clients and exercises to exceed the maximum size limit of a JSON file. With the target user in mind, it is unlikely that he will have an enormous amount of clients as he will have to cater time for each of them. Even though each client might have many exercises, the information of each exercise is relatively small. For now, collectively, the client and exercise data is unlikely to exceed the JSON size limit. We might consider to have multiple JSON files if the data size gets too big in future versions.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Personal Best --- Li Zi Ying

This feature allows the users (ie. gym managers) to view the personal bests of exercises done by a client. This information is displayed in a table form, after the command `view-c INDEX` is called.

==== Implementation

The personal best feature is facilitated by the model `PersonalBest`, and the logic behind it is in `PersonalBestFinder`. The behaviour of this feature determines the personal best of each exercise done by the client based on these considerations:

* If the `ExerciseWeight` attribute is recorded in the `Exercise`, then the `ExerciseWeight` is used as comparison
* If there is no `ExerciseWeight` recorded in the `Exercise`, then `ExerciseReps` will be used as comparison
* If neither of `ExerciseWeight` and `ExerciseReps` are recorded into the `Exercise`, then this particular exercise will not be put into the Exercise Personal Best table
** However, if the another `Exercise` of the same name is added in the future with `ExerciseWeight` and/or `ExerciseReps` specified, then the personal best of this exercise will still be calculated and shown in the Exercise Personal Best table

When the user inputs `view-c`, `add-e` or `delete-c`, `PersonalBestFinder#generateAndSetPersonalBest` is called, taking the client currently in view as the parameter. `PersonalBestFinder#generateAndSetPersonalBest` then retrieves client's list of exercises using `Client#getExerciseList` and creates a new `HashMap`, where the `key` is `ExerciseName` and the `value` is `Exercise`. Then the personal bests of each exercise of the client in view are generated using the above considerations. Finally the list of personal bests is set using `PersonalBest#setPersonalBest`.

A simplified class diagram of the classes involved in this feature is given below:

image::PersonalBestClassDiagram.png[]

In the following sequence diagram, we trace the execution for when the user decides to enter the command `view-c` into FitBiz:

image::PersonalBestSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

In designing this features, we had to decide on the placement of the `PersonalBest` class in the model to comply with the OOP standards. Currently, the `PersonalBest` model has a whole-part relationship with `Client`, with `Client` being the whole and `PersonalBest` being a part of `Client`. The alternative is to consider `PersonalBest` as a part of `Exercise` instead.

[options='header']
|====================
| Considerations | Pros and Cons
| Put `PersonalBest` as a part of `Client` |
*Pros*: Logically makes more sense, as each client has to have a list of exercises to themselves, and thus `PersonalBest` of each of these exercises

*Cons*: Might have significant conflicts as the `Client` model is changed to include one more attribute

| Put `PersonalBest` as a part of `Exercise` |
*Pros*: Keep `Exercise` data and methods separate from `Client` data and methods

*Cons*: Actually increases coupling as the logic was flawed

|====================

We decided to use the first approach of placing `PersonalBest` as a part of `Client` instead of `Exercise`. There are multiple reasons for our choice as mentioned below.

We want to maintain the OOP structure of the program. Logically, the personal best should belong to the client as the list of exercises belongs to the client. As the list of exercises is unique to every client, the personal best should also be so.

Moreover, even though personal best is generated using the list of exercises in the client, it can be instantiated even without an exercise list. Therefore it does not require the exercise class to exist and does not have a whole-part relationship with exercise. Coupling will also be increased as the client will be relying on the exercise class to generate the personal best. Therefore, the final choice was to place the personal best under client, with every client having their own personal best attribute.
