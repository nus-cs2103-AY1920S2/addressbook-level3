== Introduction
(Contributed by Aakanksha)

TA-Tracker
is a productivity tool made for *NUS School of Computing (SoC) Teaching Assistants (TAs)*
who want to be able to track and manage their *students* and *claimable
hours* in one place.

Teaching Assistants at SoC have to keep a track of:

* claimable hours so that they can fill up the TSS Claims form at the end of each semester.
* teaching-related sessions with claimable hours
* students and their contact information
* students' participation marks
* notes for certain students (such as recommendations)

Rather than managing this through several excel
spreadsheets and notes, TA-Tracker
allows TAs to track everything in a single, convenient-to-use
platform.

In particular, TA-Tracker
is a *Command Line Interface (CLI)* application packaged
with a *Graphical User Interface (GUI)*. This means that users are expected to interact
with the TA-Tracker
mainly through the command line, and each command executed will
evoke a visual response in the TA-Tracker.

Any help on the development of the TA-Tracker
would be greatly appreciated, and there
are a couple of ways that you can do so:

* contribute to TA-Tracker's code base by expanding its features
* help us improve test coverage
* propose and implement improvements on current features

This guide aims to kick-start your journey as a contributor to the TA-Tracker
by getting
you up to speed with how TA-Tracker's codebase and inner workings function. It also
hopes to serve as a useful reference to current contributors in times of confusion or
when faced with difficulties.
//end::introduction[]

== Setting up

You can refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

TA-Tracker
has been designed with `Object-Oriented Programming`
principles in mind. We also attempted to use `Defensive Programming` wherever
possible. This section serves to give a description of the
major components in the architecture of TA-Tracker. Subsequent sections
provide more information on the inner workings of individual components.

//tag::architecture[]
[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the TA-Tracker. Given below is a quick
overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shutting down the components and invoking clean-up methods where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by the other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter`: Used by many classes to write log messages to the TA-Tracker
's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the TA-Tracker.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: Handles execution of TA-Tracker
commands.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Organises the data of the TA-Tracker
into different sections.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name} Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the _Class Diagram_ given below) defines its API in the `Logic` interface
and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager` class.

.Simplified Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other
for the scenario where the user enters the command `session delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `session delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.
//end::architecture[]
//tag::ui[]

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

(Contributed by Fatin)

The _Class Diagram_ below shows how the `UI` components interact with each other.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`StudentTab`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. The UI also contains 2 more windows, namely:

. the `HelpWindow` and
. the `StatisticsWindow`

The `UI` component uses *JavaFx* UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in
matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the
layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is
specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

==== Tabs

The _Class Diagram_ below shows how the components in the `Student Tab` interact with each other.

.Structure of the Student Tab Component
image::StudentTabClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
All the `ListPanels` and `Cards` inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.
====

The UI contains 3 `tabs`:

. The `Student Tab`
. The `Session Tab`
. The `Claims Tab`

Each of these tabs consist of one or more List Panels (e.g. `StudentListPanel`) and its
respective Card (e.g. `StudentCard`). In each List Panel, the `Graphics` component of
each of the List Cells is defined by the respective Card.

The other 2 `Tabs` follow the same structure as the _Class Diagram_ above.
//end::ui[]

//tag::logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

(Contributed by Gabriel)

The `Logic` component of `TA-Tracker`:

* Processes user inputs into different `Command` objects.
* Executes `Command` objects to interact with the `Model` component.
* Saves data by interacting with the `Storage` component.

//tag::logicStructure[]
==== Logic Structure
The following _Class Diagram_ shows a simplified view of the structure of the `Logic` component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram1.png[,550]

*API*:
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

In the `Logic` component,

* `Logic` behaves as a façade class between the different TA-Tracker components
* `LogicManager` is the main driver class behind the logic of TA-Tracker
* `LogicManager` interacts with classes in the `Model` and `Storage` components
* The logic of TA-Tracker is organised into *commands* and *parsers*
* `TaTrackerParser` is the *main parser*
* A `Command` can interact with classes in the `Model` component

//end::logicStructure[]
//tag::logicOrganization[]

==== Logic Organization

The following diagram shows how the *commands* and *parsers* are organized.

.Logic Component - Organization of commands and parsers
image::LogicClassDiagram2.png[,1000]

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* The letter `X` represents the category name for a group of commands +
(e.g. `Student`, `Session`, `Module`)
* The letters `XY` represent the names of actions specific to a command category +
(e.g. `AddStudent`, `EditSession`, `DeleteModule`)
* *CommandPackageX* and *ParserPackageX* are _placeholders_ for the actual package names
====

In the *Logic* package,

* There is a *hierarchy of parsers*, starting from `TaTrackerParser`

* Within the *Parser* package, all parsers have been grouped into *smaller packages*
* Every `Command` is created by a `Parser` object with a matching name

* Within the *Commands* package, all commands have been grouped into *smaller packages*
* Every `Command` produces a `CommandResult` when executed by `LogicManager`.
This will modify the `Model` internally (e.g. _adding a student_).
* The produced `CommandResult` sends feedback to the `UI` component. This feedback includes:
** Showing messages in the `UI`
** Instructing the `UI` to perform certain actions (e.g. displaying the help window).

====
[horizontal]
In most cases, there are *two levels* of parsing before a `Command` is created +
(e.g. `SessionCommandParser` passes the remaining user input to the `AddSessionCommandParser`
for further parsing).

However, there are some cases where only *one level* of parsing is needed +
(e.g. for the `HelpCommand`, `ListCommand`, and `ExitCommand`).

.Skipping the second layer of parsers
image::LogicClassDiagram3.png[,500]

These command parsers will immediately create the respective `Command`,
*skipping the second layer* of parsers.
====

//end::logicOrganization[]
//tag::logicCommands[]

==== Overview of Commands

Within the *Commands* package, all commands have been grouped into *smaller packages*.

The following _Class Diagram_ shows the names of the *smaller packages*:

.Structure of smaller packages within the *Commands* package
image::CommandsPackageDiagram1.png[]

These smaller packages group the commands into different categories.
Furthermore, these packages *depend* on the `Command` class
since they contain classes that inherit from it.

For example, the *Module* package contains the following classes that inherit from the `Command` class:

* `AddModuleCommand`
* `DeleteModuleCommand`
* `EditModuleCommand`

//end::logicCommands[]
//tag::logicParsers[]

==== Overview of Parsers

Within the *Parser* package, all parsers have been grouped into *smaller packages*.

These packages have been organised in the same way as the *Commands* package.

.Structure of smaller packages within the *Parser* package
image::ParserPackageDiagram1.png[]

These smaller packages group the parsers into different categories.
Furthermore, these packages *depend* on the `Parser` interface
since they contain classes that implement it.

For example, the *Module* package contains the following classes that implement the `Parser` interface:

* `AddModuleCommandParser`
* `DeleteModuleCommandParser`
* `EditModuleCommandParser`

//end::logicParsers[]
//tag::logicSequence[]

==== Example Logic Sequence

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows all the interactions inside the `Logic` component
when executing the `group add m/CS2103 g/G03 t/lab` command.

.Interactions inside the Logic Component during the `group add m/CS2103 g/G03 t/lab` command
image::AddGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* The lifeline for `GroupCommandParser` and `AddGroupCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* Since the purpose of this diagram is to show the interactions within the `Logic` component,
irrelevant interactions with the `Model` component have been omitted.
====
//end::logicSequence[]
//end::logic[]

//tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

(Contributed by Fatin)

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how the different `Model` components interact with each other.

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences
* Stores the TA-Tracker
data
* Exposes 5 unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` objects:
. `filteredStudentList`, which contains all the `Students` in the TA-Tracker

. `filteredSessionList`, which contains all the `Sessions` in the TA-Tracker
that have *not* been marked as done
. `filteredDoneSessionList`, which contains all the `Sessions` in the TA-Tracker
that *have been marked as done*
. `filteredModuleList`, which contains all the `Modules` in the TA-Tracker

. `filteredGroupList`, which contains all the `Groups` in the TA-Tracker

* These lists can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change
* Does not depend on any of the other three components

The following _Class Diagram_ shows the relationship between the different classes
in the `Model` component.

.Model Components - Class Diagram
image::ModelComponentsClassDiagram.png[,670]

==== Example of Model Usage

The following _Object Diagram_ shows an example of the relationship between the different `Model` objects.
This example is based on the state of TA-Tracker
when it is first run (without any user data).

.Model Components - Object Diagram

//end::model[]

//tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
(Contributed by Gabriel)

The following _Class Diagram_ shows a simplified view of the `Storage` component.

.Simplified structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram1.png[]

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* Can save `UserPref` objects in Json format, and read it back
* Can save all TA-Tracker data in Json format, and read it back.

==== Saved Data
The following _Class Diagram_ shows a breakdown of the data managed by the `Storage` component.

.Structure of the data stored by TA-Tracker
image::StorageClassDiagram2.png[]

TA-Tracker saves the following data in _Json format_:

* A list of `Module` objects representing the *modules* that the user is teaching
* A list of `Session` objects representing the *sessions* that the user has not completed (*not marked as done*)

Within each `Module`, there is:

* A list of `Session` objects, representing the *sessions* that the user has completed (*marked as done*) for that module
* A list of `Group` objects, representing the *groups* for that module that the user is in charge of, such as a tutorial or lab

Within each `Group`, there is:

* A list of `Student` objects, representing the students enrolled in the group
//end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tatracker.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::logicDesign[]
[[Logic]]
=== Logic
(Contributed by Gabriel)

The *Logic* of TA-Tracker ensures that all the user's commands are parsed and executed correctly.
In order to ensure that all the commands contain the correct information,
two utility classes have been created:

* A `CommandDetails` class to encapsulate details, such as the usage message,
inside each `Command` in TA-Tracker.
+
This is used to:

** Fetch messages for `CommandResult` objects
** List commands in the `HelpWindow`
** Simplify the number of imports used in test cases

* A `PrefixDetails` class to encapsulate details, such as the usage message,
of each `Prefix` used in TA-Tracker.

Both utility classes support the <<Syntax, Syntax Highlighting feature>>.

The `CommandDetails` of every `Command` are stored in a `CommandDictionary`,
The `PrefixDetails` of every `Prefix` are stored in a `PrefixDictionary`.

The following sections will describe the implementation of these two dictionaries.

//tag::commandDictionary[]
==== Implementation of the CommandDictionary

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how a `CommandDictionary` stores all the
details of every `Command` in TA-Tracker.

.Structure of the CommandDictionary
image::CommandsPackageDiagram2.png[,400]

. The `CommandDictionary`, stores a list of `CommandDetails` for all the commands in TA-Tracker.
. All commands should have their own `CommandDetails`.
. A `CommandDetails` object stores all the information that a command should have +
(e.g. their `commandWord` and `usage` message).
. For their `commandWord` and `sub word`, commands may use constants in `CommandWords` to avoid repetition +
(e.g. "add", "delete", "edit").

//end::commandDictionary[]
//tag::prefixDictionary[]

==== Implementation of the PrefixDictionary

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how a `PrefixDictionary` stores all the
details of every `Prefix` in TA-Tracker.

.Structure of the PrefixDictionary
image::ParserPackageDiagram2.png[,400]

. A `PrefixDictionary` stores two lists of `Prefix` objects:
** `parameters` - a list of compulsory parameters for a command
** `optionals` - a list of optional parameters for a command

. A `PrefixDictionary` contains a list of `PrefixDetails`.
These `PrefixDetails` are the details of all the `Prefix` objects stored in `parameters` and `optionals`

. A `PrefixDetails` object adds more information to a `Prefix` +
(e.g. their `constraint` message and a list of `examples`).
. A `PrefixDetail` has a `Predicate` to validate the user input arguments.

. All parsers use some `Prefix` constants defined in `Prefixes`.
These constants are kept in `PrefixDictionary` in a lookup table.

====
The difference between the *commands* and *parsers* is that the *commands* store their own `CommandDetails`,
while the *parsers* do not store any `PrefixDetails`.

This is because the *parsers* do not need the extra information stored in `PrefixDetails`.
They only need to use different `Prefix` objects in order to parse user inputs.

`PrefixDetails` adds more information to a `Prefix` object instead of extending it.
Therefore, it can be detached from the *parsers* without changing the `Prefix` constants in `Prefixes`.
====
//end::prefixDictionary[]
//end::logicDesign[]

//tag::goto[]
[[Implementation-Goto]]
=== Goto Command

(Contributed by Fatin)

==== Description

The `goto` command has been implemented to allow users to programmatically switch through the `tabs` using
the command line, rather than clicking on the tab headers.

The command can be utilised by entering `goto TAB_NAME`.
`TAB_NAME` is a compulsory parameter for the user.

==== Implementation
This section describes the implementation of the `goto` command.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions between the `Logic` and `UI` components of
the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the command `goto claims`.

.Sequence Diagram for Goto Claims Command
image::GotoSequenceDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example scenario where the user enters a command to switch to the `Claims Tab`.

. The user command is passed through the `LogicManager` to `TaTrackerParser`.
`TaTrackerParser` checks the input arguments and identify the String keywords.

. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a `GotoCommand` and passes the command
to the `GotoCommandParser`.

. The `GotoCommandParser` creates a `GotoCommand` object
with the relevant keywords.

. `LogicManager` calls `GotoCommand#execute()`.

. The `GotoCommand` object checks whether any of the keywords given by the user
matches the existing tab headers.

.. If it does, the `GotoCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message and an enum specifying
how MainWindow should handle the next action.

.. If it doesn't, an exception is thrown.

. `MainWindow` calls the handleGoto() method to select the `ClaimsTab` in the `TabPane`, completing the tab-switching
process.
//end::goto[]

[[StudentView]]
=== Student View
*Student View* is used to display all modules, groups and students in the TA-Tracker.

Students are a part of *groups* and groups are a part of *modules*.

//tag::studentviewmodel[]
==== Implementation of the Model Framework

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the
functioning of the *Student View*.

.Student View - Class Diagram
image::ModuleModelClassDiagram.png[,670]

In the diagram above, you can see that:

* The `TaTracker` class contains a `UniqueModuleList` which helps it keep track
of the different *modules* the user is teaching.

* Each `Module` contains a `UniqueGroupList`.

* Each `UniqueGroupList` contains a list of all the *groups of a module* that the user
is teaching.

* Each `Group` contains a `UniqueStudentsList` that contains the *students in that group*.

====
*Design Considerations*

The initial idea for the *Student View* UI was to show the Student View as a *list of modules*
where each module contained a *list of groups* and each group contained a *list of students*.
Keeping this in mind, we created the current model framework.

The idea for the UI was scrapped as once we realised it would look messy and won't
be user-friendly. We changed the UI to what it is now, but decided to keep the model framework
the way it is.

*Alternative Implementation*

* An alternative implementation would be to have a single `UniqueModuleList` to store
all modules, a `List` to store all groups and a `List` to store all students.

* We would then have to *filter by module code and/or group code* to show the appropriate
groups and students.

* This would require *students to keep track of which group and which module they're
a part of*. Similarly, *groups would have to keep a track of the students they contain*.
This would create a **cyclic dependency** (which could be solved using an association class).

* The `List` of groups could contain multiple groups with the same group code as group code
is only unique within a module. Group codes can be shared across modules.

* While this implementation would make it easier to generate a report at the end of
the semester (explained later in the guide), it would require more commands
and the *creation of many association classes* which would unnecessarily
*complicate the model*.
That is why we decided to stick to our current implementation.

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the functioning of a `Student` Object.

.Structure of the Student Component
image::StudentClassDiagram.png[,670]

*API*: link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/tatracker/model/student/Student.java[`Student.java`]

The other models (`Module`, `Group` and `Session`) have been implemented in a similar manner.
The main difference is that the other models do not
have any `Tags`.

[NOTE]
As a more `OOP` model, we can store a `Tag` list in `TaTracker`, which `Student` can
reference. This would allow `TaTracker` to only require one `Tag` object per unique
`Tag`, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of what
such a model may look like is given below. +

//end::studentmodel[]
//tag::moduleaddeditdelete[]

==== Implementation of the Module Add, Delete and Edit Commands

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions
between the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the
command `module add m/CS2103 n/Software Engineering`.

.Module Add - Sequence Diagram
image::AddModuleSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* This diagram assumes that a module with the module code `CS2103`
doesn't exist in the TA-Tracker.

* The lifeline for `ModuleCommandParser` and `AddModuleCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that this command is a *module command* and passes the
command to the `ModuleCommandParser`.

3. The `ModuleCommandParser` sees that this command is an *add command* and passes the
arguments to the `AddModuleCommandParser`.

4. The `AddModuleCommandParser` creates a `Module` with the given module code and
name.

5. The `AddModuleCommandParser` then creates an `AddModuleCommand` object with a newly
created module. The parser then returns the `AddModuleCommand` object.

6. `LogicManager` calls `AddModuleCommand#execute()`.

7. The `AddModuleCommand` object
checks whether a module with the given module code already exists in *TA-Tracker*

.. If it does, a *command exception is thrown* saying that a module with the given module
code already exists in the *TA-Tracker*.

.. If no such module exists, the *module is added to the TA-Tracker*.

8. The `AddModuleCommand` returns a `CommandResult`.

The command used to delete a module has been implemented in a similar way. The main
difference is that when the `DeleteModuleCommand` checks whether an object with the given
module code exists in the TA-Tracker

.. If no such module exists, a *command exception
is thrown* saying that a module with the given module code doesn't exist.

.. If it does
exist, *first all the sessions linked to that module are removed* , then the module
is removed from the TA-Tracker


The `module edit` command has been implemented in a similar manner.
//end::moduleaddeditdelete[]
//tag::groupaddeditdelete[]

==== Implementation of the Group Add, Delete and Edit Commands

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

A *group* is added to the TA-Tracker
in a similar manner to  how a *module* is added to
the TA-Tracker.

The following steps are taken once the _execute_ method of an `AddGroupCommand` object
is called:

. The `AddGroupCommand` object checks whether the *module* is present in the model of the TA-Tracker
.
.. If it exists, the *module is retrieved*.
.. If it doesn't exist, an *exception is thrown* explaining that the module doesn't
exist.
. The `AddGroupCommand` object checks whether a *group* with the same group code as
the new group exists in the module retrieved beforehand.
.. If it doesn't exist, the *group is added to the module* and a `CommandResult` object
with the success message is returned.
.. If it does exist, an *exception is thrown* explaining that you can't have two groups
with the same group code in a module.

The interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components when adding a group are similar
to the interactions when deleting a group as shown below.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model`
components when the user inputs the command `group delete m/CS2103 g/G03`.

.Group Delete - Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* This diagram is under the case where a group with the group code G03 does exist
in the module with module code CS2103 inside the TA-Tracker.

* The lifeline for `GroupCommandParser` and `DeleteGroupCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* The main difference between the `Module` and `Group` commands is that the `Group`
commands require extra checks to check whether a group with the given group code
exists inside the module with the given module code.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a *group command* and passes the
command to the `GroupCommandParser`.

3. The `GroupCommandParser` sees that the command is a *delete command* and passes the
arguments to the `DeleteGroupCommandParser`.

4. The `DeleteGroupCommandParser` then creates a `DeleteGroupCommand` object and passes
it the module code, group code and group type. The parser then returns the `DeleteGroupCommand` object.

5. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteGroupCommand#execute()`. The `DeleteGroupCommand` object
checks whether a *module* with the given module code already exists in TA-Tracker
If it doesn't, a *command exception is thrown* saying that a module with the given module
code doesn't exist in the TA-Tracker

6. If the module exists, the `DeleteGroupCommand` then checks whether a group with the
given group code exists within that module.
.. If the group doesn't exist, a *command exception is thrown* saying that no such group exists.
.. If the group does exist, it is *removed from the module*.

7. The `DeleteGroupCommand` returns a `CommandResult`.

The `group edit` command has been implemented in a similar manner.
//end::groupaddeditdelete[]
//tag::studentaddeditdelete[]

==== Implementation of the Student Add, Delete and Edit Commands
(Contributed by Gabriel)

A *student* can be added to the TA-Tracker after a *module* and *group* is added.

The commands for *students* are similar to the commands for *modules* and *groups*.
The main difference is that there are a few additional conditions in order to
ensure that a *student* is inside the TA-Tracker.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions that take place
between the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the command `student delete m/CS2103 g/G03 id/A0181234G`.

.Student Delete - Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png[,1000]

[NOTE]
====

* This diagram assumes that the following data are inside the TA-Tracker:
** A student with the matric number `A0181234G` +
(shown as `id` in the diagram)
** The same student inside the group `G03` +
(shown as `g` in the diagram)
** The same group inside the module `CS2103` +
(shown as `m` in the diagram) +
{fbl}

* The lifeline for `StudentCommandParser` and `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
====

. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a *student command* and passes the
command to the `StudentCommandParser`.

. The `StudentCommandParser` sees that the command is a *delete command* and passes the
arguments to the `DeleteStudentCommandParser`.

. The `DeleteStudentCommandParser` then creates a `DeleteStudentCommand` object
with the *matric number*, *module code* and *group code* from the arguments.
The parser then returns the `DeleteStudentCommand`.

. `LogicManager` calls `DeleteStudentCommand#execute()` to begin removing a student from the TA-Tracker.

. The `DeleteStudentCommand` checks the following three conditions:
.. A module with the given *module code* is inside the TA-Tracker.
.. A group with the given *group code* is inside the same module.
.. A student with the given *matric number* is inside the same group.

. For each condition, there are two outcomes:
.. If the condition is false, then a *command exception is thrown* saying that the object does not exist.
.. If it is true, then the student with the given *matric number* is removed from
the *expected group* inside the *expected module*.

. Finally, the `DeleteStudentCommand` returns a `CommandResult`.
.. If the command successfully removed a student, the `CommandResult` will contain a success message.
.. If not, the `CommandResult` will have a message explaining why the student could not be removed.

The `student add` and `student edit` command has been implemented in a similar manner.
However, the `student add` command has a slight difference.

When the `student add` command is executed,
there is an extra condition that must be true: there cannot be a student with the given *matric number* already inside
the *expected group* inside the *expected module*.

==== Implementation of the Sort Group, Module and All Command

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

The sort command allows the user to sort the students in the *Student View*.

The sort command can be used in three ways:

1. `sort group g/GROUP_CODE m/MODULE_CODE t/TYPE` : This sorts all the students of the *given
group in the given module* by type `TYPE`.

2. `sort module g/MODULE_CODE t/TYPE` : This sorts all the students of *all the groups in the
given module* by type `TYPE`.

3. `sort all t/TYPE` : This sorts all students of *all groups in all modules* in the
TA-Tracker
by the type `TYPE`

[NOTE]
====
* `TYPE` here could mean any of the following:
** `alpha`, `alphabetical` or `alphabetically` to sort alphabetically.
** `rating asc` to sort by rating in ascending order.
** `rating desc` to sort by rating in descending order.
** `matric` to sort by matriculation number.
====

Since the `Sort` commands function differently but use a single parser,
the structure shown in the following
_Class Diagram_ is used.

.Sort Commands - Class Diagram
image::SortCommandsClassDiagram.png[,400]

[NOTE]
====
* `SortGroupCommand` sorts the students in a particular group of a
particular module.
* `SortModuleCommand` sorts the students in all groups of all modules.
* `SortCommand` sorts the students in all groups of all modules.
====
Since the different commands use the same parser,
the `SortCommandParser` needs to check the sub-command word and return
the appropriate sort command.

The following _Activity Diagram_ shows the steps the `SortCommandParser` takes once
its _parse_ method is called (assuming that no exception is thrown).

.SortCommandParser - Activity Diagram
image::SortParserActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* The sub-command word here refers to `all`, `module` or `group`. If none of the above
sub-command words is used, a *command exception* will be thrown, explaining that it is an
invalid command.

* If the user enters the `sort` command with a command word but *doesn't include the
appropriate parameters with the correct prefixes, a command exception is thrown*.
====

The following _Sequence Diagram_ illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and
`Model` components when the user enters the command `sort all t/matric`.

.Sort - Sequence Diagram
image::SortAllSequenceDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

* The `SortCommandParser`, which creates `Sort` commands, is different from the other
command parsers. While the other commands have another level of parsing (such as the
`ModuleCommandParser` for `Module` commands), the `SortCommandParser`
creates all the different Sort commands within itself.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a *sort command* and passes the
command to the `SortCommandParser`.

3. The `SortCommandParser` performs the steps shown in the previous activity diagram
and determines that since the sub-command word is `all` , it must create and return a
`SortCommand`.

4. `LogicManager` calls `SortCommand#execute()`.

5. `SortCommand` checks the type of sorting that is indicated. Since the sort type
is `matric` , it calls `Model#sortModulesByMatricNumber()` command.

6. The `SortCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a `Session` command and passes the command
to the `SessionCommandParser`.

3. The `SessionCommandParser` sees that the command is a `DoneSessionCommand` and passes the
arguments to the `DoneSessionCommandParser`.

4. The `DoneSessionCommandParser` creates a `DoneSessionCommand` with the given index.

5. `LogicManager` calls `DoneSessionCommand#execute()` method.

6. The `DoneSessionCommand`
checks whether the current session called by the user has a recurring period.

    a. If it does, a new session with the updated date will be added to `Model#UniqueSessionList()`.
    b. If it does not have a recurring period, it will move on to *Step 6*.

7. The current session is marked as done and will be removed from `Model#UniqueSessionList`.

8. The updated session list will be displayed to the user.

==== Implementation of Session Add, Edit and Delete

(Contributed by Chua Yi Jing)

The `session edit` and `session delete` commands have been implemented in a similar manner
to `DoneSessionCommand`.


The `session add` command has been implemented in a similar way. The main difference is that the
`SessionAddCommand` checks whether an object with the given module code exists in the TA-Tracker.

* If no such module code exists, the session is created successfully.

* If it doesn’t exist, an exception is thrown saying that the given module code doesn’t exist.

*Claims View* refers to the view that contains a list of all the sessions that have
been done.

==== Model Framework
The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the
functioning of the *Claims View*.

The TaTracker model class contains a UniqueDoneSessionList which keeps track of
all the *sessions that have been marked as done*. Each of the sessions must belong to a Module in the UniqueModuleList.

==== Set Rate Command

Given below is an example scenario where the user enters the command `setrate 50`.

. The user command is passed through the `LogicManager` to `TaTrackerParser`.

. `TaTrackerParser` checks the input arguments and identify the String keywords.

. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a type of SetRate and passes the command
to the `SetRateCommandParser`.

. The `SetRateCommandParser` object checks that the given `RATE` input
by the user is a valid integer. If it is, the `SetRateCommandParser` creates a
`SetRateCommand` object with the relevant integer.

. `LogicManager` calls `SetRateCommand` 's execute method.

. `MainWindow` updates the `TotalEarnings` label in the `ClaimsTab` and the `StatisticsWindow`

[[Implementation-Filter]]
=== Filter Command
(Contributed by Chua Yi Jing)

==== Description

Different view has its own designated filter command.

====
* *Student View*, has the `student filter`
* *Session View*, has the `session filter`
* *Claims View*, has the `claims filter`
====

==== Implementation
This section describes the implementation of the `filter` command.

The _Activity Diagram_ below summarises what happens when the user executes a `filter` command:

._Activity Diagram_ of the Filter Command
image::FilterCommandActivityDiagram.png[,1100]

The filter feature consists of three main steps:

1. *Validating and parsing* user input

2. Creating a *filtering predicate* from user's input

3. *Updating the filtered* list with the *filtering predicate*

===== Filter under Student View

Students are filtered based on the module code and/or
group code given by the user.

Module code is a compulsory parameter for the user.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the sequence of commands that take place between
the `Logic` and `Model` components of the Ta-Tracker when the user enters the command
`student filter m\CS2103T g\G06`. This command will return students from module code `CS2103T`, under group `G06`.

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* The lifeline for `StudentCommandParser` and `FilterStudentCommandParser` should end at the
destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
===

Given below is an example scenario where the user enters a command to filter students.

. The user command is passed through the `LogicManager` to `TaTrackerParser`.
`TaTrackerParser` checks the input arguments and identify the String keywords.

. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a type of Student and passes the command
to the `StudentCommandParser`.

. The `StudentCommandParser` sees that the command is a type of filter and passes the
arguments to the `FilterStudentCommandParser`.

. The `FilterStudentCommandParser` creates a `FilterStudentCommand` object
with the relevant keywords.

. `LogicManager` calls `FilterStudentCommand#execute()`.

. The `FilterStudentCommand` object checks whether any of the keywords given by the user matches the existing
module and/or group.
.. If it doesn't, a `CommandException` is thrown saying that no such students exists.
.. If it does, the `FilterStudentCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

===== Filter under Session View

Sessions can be filtered with the following parameters:

* `d/DATE`
* `m/MODULE CODE`
* `t/SESSION_TYPE`

These parameters can be used alone or together.

The command used to filter sessions has been implemented in a similar way. The main
difference is that the `FilterSessionCommandParser` creates a `SessionPredicate` object.
The `SessionPredicate` object updates the filtered session list by keywords in Model.
The filtered list will then be displayed.

When the user specifies a keyword, sessions that contain the keywords will be filtered and shown to the user.
If none of the keywords supplied by the user appears in any sessions, a `CommandException`
will be shown.

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the functioning of
the `SessionFilter` Command.

.Class Diagram for Filter Session Command
image::FindCommandClassDiagram.png[]

===== Filter under Claims View

The user can only filter the *Claims View* by module code.
When the user enters the command `claims filter m/MODULE_CODE`, claims that contain the module code
will be filtered.

The command used to filter claims is implemented the same way as `SessionFilterCommand`.
//end::filter[]

[[Syntax]]
=== Syntax Highlighting
(Contributed by Gabriel)

When a user types a command, their inputs will be highlighted in different colours
as a form of input validation.

In addition, different messages will be displayed based on the result of the syntax highlighting.

The following _screenshot_ shows how the `CommandBox` and `ResultDisplay` appear in the TA-Tracker.

.The CommandBox and the ResultDisplay in TA-Tracker
image::syntax-highlighting/ui.png[,600]

In the _screenshot_ above:

* There is a user input highlighted in `green` in the `CommandBox`
* There is a message in `white` showing in the `ResultDisplay`
* The command being entered is `session edit`
* The user has entered three arguments: `date`, `start time`, and `end time`.

==== Overview
The following _Class Diagram_ shows how the `Logic` and `UI` components interact with each other to produce the highlighting.

.Syntax Highlighting - Class Diagram
image::SyntaxHighlightingClassDiagram.png[]

The `CommandBox`:

* Uses a `CommandDictionary` to search for valid commands
* Stores a `CommandDetail` for processing the current command in the user input
* Stores a `PrefixDictionary` containing the `PrefixDetails` for the current command.
* Uses `PrefixDetails` to process each argument in the current command
* Uses a `CommandBoxUtil` to validate user inputs
* Returns feedback to the `ResultDisplay`

The `ResultDisplay` displays the given feedback as a message in the TA-Tracker.

==== Identifying the parts of a User Input

Here is an example of a user input in the `CommandBox`:

.An example of a user input in the `CommandBox`

[[Impl-Syntax]]
==== Implementation of the Syntax Highlighting
The following diagrams show the steps that take place when applying syntax highlighting
to the user's input.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the limitations of *PlantUML*, the following _Activity Diagrams_
may not follow UML notation.

In particular, there are issues with representing alternate branches.

For example, alternate branches:

* *Split into multiple branch nodes*, instead of all originating from the same node
* *Do not converge* at a single merge node before the end node


There is a way for the diagrams to be arranged vertically.
However, this dilates the diagrams, making them difficult to fit in this guide.

====

[[SH-1]]
===== Step 1 - Highlighting a new input
Syntax highlighting is applied when the user changes their input in the `CommandBox`.

The following _Activity Diagram_ shows how the `full command word` is highlighted,
up until the beginning of the `preamble`.

.Step 1 - Highlighting a new input
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram1.png[,950]

NOTE: There should be a _rake symbol_ next to the *bolded* activity - *Highlight arguments*.

===== Step 2 - Highlighting the preamble
If the new input has a `full command word`,
the next step is to apply syntax highlighting on the `preamble` and `arguments`.

The following _Activity Diagram_ shows how the `preamble` is highlighted,
up until the beginning of the first `argument`.

.Step 2 - Highlighting the preamble

===== Step 3 - Highlighting the remaining arguments
After the `preamble` has been verified,
the syntax highlighting is applied on each `argument` in the remaining user input.
An _invalid_ or _wrong_ `argument` will *stop* the highlighting.

The following _Activity Diagram_ explains how each `argument` is highlighted,
up until end of the user input.

==== Design Considerations

[[Syntax-Aspect1]]
===== Showing the command usage after every two white spaces

When a user enters two white spaces, the usage for the current command wil reappear in
the `ResultDisplay`. The purpose of this is to provide the user with a *quick example*
of how to use the command, since a command may have *a lot of parameters*.

The following are reasons why the usage appears after every two spaces:

* The user will have to enter whitespaces frequently.
This should allow our *target users* (whom are fast typers) to *quickly verify* how to use the different commands.
* A user input will usually have words separated with a single white space
* It gives a use for user inputs to have `arguments` separated with more than one whitespace

====
*Alternative Implementation*

An alternative would be to *assign a keyboard shortcut*, such as the kbd:[Tab] key,
to give the user the option to display the command usage only when they need it.

Currently, the `ResultDisplay` shows the command usage
whenever the user inputs something new. This could be annoying for the user
when they are familiar with the commands.

However, the user may have assigned actions to these keyboard shortcuts on their computer,
Therefore, TA-Tracker would need to allow the user to *assign their own keyboard settings*.

As TA-Tracker is meant to be used primarily on the *CLI*, assigning keyboard shortcuts
does not seem like a suitable feature for our *target users*. However, implementing this
is an option in future versions of TA-Tracker.
====

[[Syntax-Aspect2]]
===== Always showing the syntax highlighting

Similar to <<Syntax-Aspect1, the previous design consideration>>, the syntax highlighting
could instead be toggled _on_ and _off_ using a keyboard shortcut.

====
*Alternative Implementation*

Alternatively, there could be a command to toggle the syntax highlighting _on_ and _off_.

Here is an example of how the command could be made:

* `syntax on` - enables the syntax highlighting
* `syntax off` - disables the syntax highlighting
* `syntax cmd` - enables the syntax highlighting for `full command words` only
* `syntax args` - enables the syntax highlighting for `arguments` only

Then, the `CommandBox` will have _boolean flags_ to toggle the syntax highlighting
before the each of the three steps explained in the <<Impl-Syntax, Implementation of the Syntax Highlighting>>.

//end::syntaxhighlighting[]

//tag::statistic[]

=== Statistic Report Generation
(Contributed by Haoyi)

==== Description

The *Statistics Window* can be generated and displayed using the `report` command.
The command is used to generate a report to display information such as:

* A breakdown and summary of completed sessions
* The number of hours of each type of completed sessions
* A breakdown of your student’s ratings

A module code can be specified such that the generated report will only include data from a specific module.

==== Implementation

This section describes the implementation of the `report` command.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions between the `UI` and the `Logic` components of TA-Tracker,
when the user enters the command `report CS3247`.

.Sequence Diagram for Statistic Report Generation
image::ReportSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following is an example scenario when the user requests for a report of a particular module,
with the command `report CS3247`.

. The user command is first read by `MainWindow`, through JavaFX.
`MainWindow` passes the command as a `String` to the `LogicManager` to be processed.

. `LogicManager` sends the command to `TaTrackerParser` for the command to be parsed.

. The `TaTrackerParser` processes the first word in the command, and identifies it as a `ShowStatisticCommand`.

. `TaTrackerParser` creates a `ShowStatisticCommandParser` object and passes the command argument `CS3247`
to the `ShowStatisticCommandParser` object.

. The `ShowStatisticCommandParser` stores the target module, `CS3247`, in a `ShowStatisticCommand` object and
this command object is returned all the way back to the `LogicManager`.

. `LogicManager` executes the `ShowStatisticCommand`, which creates and return a `StatiscCommandResult`. This command
result is returned by `LogicManager` to `MainWindow`

. `MainWindow` detects that the command result is of type `StatisticCommandResult`, and prepares the `StatisticWindow`
by creating a `Statistic` object that retrieves data necessary for generating the report, from `ReadOnlyTaTracker`.

. The data is then processed further by `Statistic`. This includes computing the total number of sessions per session type and sorting the students by rating.

. A `StatisticWindow` object is now created by `MainWindow`. The `Statistic` object is passed into the constructor of `StatisticWindow`.

. Finally, `StatisticWindow` updates its FXML elements and is shown to the user.
//end::statistic[]
//tag::logging[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE`: Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING`: Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO`: Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE`: Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
//end::logging[]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.. user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Effort

(Contributed by Fatin and Aakanksha)

Creating this application was fairly difficult and required much blood, toil, tears and sweat. Cumulatively, the
project amasses a great *20,000 lines of code* combined. This meant that it required a great deal of *communication and
discussion amongst all parties*, which was _especially difficult_ due to the quarantine measures that resulted from the
on-going COVID-19 situation. However, the 5 of us persevered and remedied the situation by holding regular video
conferences to replace our weekly group meetings.

While AB3 deals with only one entity, this application deals with *multiple entities*.

* *AB3* contains only `Person`. While we were able to refactor some aspects of `Person` into `Student`, we had to create
`Session`, `Group` and `Module` from scratch.
* The `UI` of *AB3* only contains one `ListPanel`. On the other hand, TA-Tracker has *5 `ListPanels`* spread out in 3 views -
the *StudentView*, *SessionView* and *ClaimsView*. This is a big change from *AB3’s* `UI`.
*  We also have a `StatisticsWindow in addition to our `HelpWindow`, which is significantly more appealing than the
*AB3* `HelpWindow`.

Furthermore, *TA-Tracker’s* additional features such as `automated tab switching`, `filtering`, `sorting` and `syntax
highlighting` meant that our app varies greatly from what *AB3* has to offer in terms of user experience. These carefully
thought out features were _designed primarily with the user’s needs in mind_, to provide the user with a platform that
would greatly improve the efficiency of tracking duties as a TA.

Due to our inexperience with `UI` work, we had initially planned the *StudentView* to look very different. Therefore, the way
it was initially implemented differed significantly from the current one. Once we became more familiar with *JavaFX*, we
realised that our initial plan was no longer feasible within our given timeframe. As a result, we had to change the
implementation of *StudentView*. Furthermore, a lot of supporting methods were required to allow the `UI` to work the
way it does.

Another challenge we faced was that we were unaware of restrictions regarding *temporal-based features*. Two of our
features _relied heavily on timing_, and as a result, they had to be scrapped from the project. This also resulted in our
group having to do a lot of last-minute brainstorming to come up with ideas for new features as replacements.
Fortunately, we managed to pull through by designing a highly useful `StatisticsWindow` to improve upon our current
application.

During this whole process, we took great pains to ensure that the *code quality* of our code-base was upheld by verifying
every pull request that we make with thorough peer reviews from at least one other party. Nonetheless, our actions
paid off as we managed to maintain a *Codacy rating of A* throughout the project.
