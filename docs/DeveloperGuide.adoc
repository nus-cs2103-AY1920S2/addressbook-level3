== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

tag::schedule[]

=== Schoolwork Tracker
[.text-justify]
The `SchoolworkTracker` helps users keep track of their assignments so that they do not accidentally overlook any of them.

[.text-justify]
From *Fig 1* below, each `Assignment` has four components: `Title`, `Deadline`, `Status` and `Workload`. `Workload` refers to the expected amount of time required to finish the `Assignment`. These components will be used for schedule generation when `(st)schedule n/NUM_DAYS` is executed (explained below).

image::stClassDiagram.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 1. Class Diagram detailing the main components of the SchoolworkTracker_

=== Schedule
==== Current Implementation


[.text-justify]
Schedule is facilitated by the `SchoolworkTracker`. This feature enhances the basic form of the `SchoolworkTracker` by allowing users to better visualise their current commitments so that they can better manage their time to pursue social events. This feature aims to distribute `Workload` as evenly as possible while ensuring that the user is able to complete the `Assignment` before the `Deadline`, unless it is impossible (i.e. `Workload` exceeds the amount of time the user has before the `Deadline` after taking into account more urgent assignments). A sample result is shown in *Fig 2* below.

image::scheduleResult.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 2. Sample result of the generated schedule_

[.text-justify]
It utilizes the existing `Assignment` stored in the `SchoolworkTracker` and implements `ScheduleList` which represents the generated schedule.

[.text-justify]
As seen from *Fig 3* below, `ScheduleList` consists of `Day` objects and each `Day` has 3 components. `totalAllocatedHours` represents the total number of hours allocated to the `Day`.
`dueAssignment` refers to an assignment that is due on the `Day` and `allocatedAssignment` represents an assignment that has been scheduled to be done on that `Day`. The latter also has an additional field `allocatedHours` which correspond to the suggested amount of time
that should be spent on the assignment on that `Day`.

image::scheduleClassDiagram.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 3. Class Diagram detailing the main components of ScheduleList_

[.text-justify]
Given below is a detailed example of how the schedule command behaves at each stage.

[.text-justify]
*Step 1*: User launches `Naggy Joel` for the first time. `SchoolworkTracker` is initialized to an empty list.
[.text-justify]
*Step 2*: User executes the add assignment command [`(st)add n/NAME d/DEADLINE e/ESTIMATED_COMPLETION_HOURS`] to add assignments to the `SchoolworkTracker`.
[.text-justify]
*Step 3*: User wants to better understand his schedule for the next 5 days before deciding whether he has time to hang out with his friends and executes `(st)schedule n/5`.

[.text-justify]
As seen from *Fig 4* below, after the user enters the schedule command, the command will first be checked for validity. If it is not valid, the user will be informed and can then choose whether to re-enter the command or enter another command. On the other hand, if the input command is valid, the application will proceed to generate his schedule and after display it on the GUI.

image::scheduleActivityDiagram.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 4. Activity Diagram summarizing what happens when the schedule command is executed_

[.text-justify]
The specific workings of the schedule command will be explained in the paragraphs below.

[.text-justify]
As seen from *Fig 5* below, arguments from the input command is first parsed using the `ScheduleCommandParser` which converts
the string variable into an integer and then passes it to `ScheduleCommand` for use later on and represents the `NUM_DAYS` queried. If the input argument is invalid, a `ParseException`
is thrown instead and the user will be notified of the proper command usage. If the command is valid, the `ScheduleCommand` object will be created and returned to the `LogicManager` who will then call the `execute()` method in `ScheduleCommand`.

image::scheduleCommandGeneration.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 5. Sequence Diagram depicting generation of ScheduleCommand object_

[.text-justify]


[.text-justify]
As seen from *Fig 6* below, the necessary preparations will be made before the schedule is being generated:

1. The `ScheduleCommand` will retrieve the `filteredAssignments` from the `Model` component.

2. The `ScheduleList` will then be initialized to have a size equals to the `NUM_DAYS` queried by the user, which in this example is `5` since the user typed `(st)schedule n/5`.

image::scheduleCommandExecution.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 6. Sequence Diagram showing the execution of the ScheduleCommand_

[.text-justify]
The schedule generation process will be explained next and begins with Fig 7.

[.text-justify]
In *Fig 7* below, `filteredAssignments` is iterated through in sorted order, starting with the `Assignment` due the earliest and for all assignments:

1. The `Status` and `Deadline` of the `Assignment` will be retrieved.
2. If `Status` is uncompleted and `Deadline` is not over, `Workload` will be distributed.

image::generateSchedule.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 7. Sequence Diagram showing the process of generating the schedule_

[.text-justify]
As shown in *Fig 8* below, for each uncompleted `Assignment`:

1. `Workload` is retrieved and distributed across several days, from query date to deadline, incrementally so as to generate a balanced schedule.
2. The final allocation of hours, including amount unscheduled, is recorded and the `Assignment` will be recorded as a `dueAssignment` if its deadline falls within the range of days queried.

image::handleUncompletedAssignment.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 8 Sequence Diagram showing how an uncompleted Assignment is handled_

image::allocateHours.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 9. Sequence Diagram showing how the workload of an assignment is distributed_

[.text-justify]
From *Fig 9* above, assignments due on query date are handled differently from those that are not.

* If the `Assignment` is *due* on the query date: The amount of time that can be allocated to the assignment will be capped at the amount of time available before the `Deadline`.
* If the `Assignment` is *not due* on the query date: `Workload` will be distributed incrementally.
** Between query date and deadline (both exclusive): Available time is capped at 24 hours.
** Query date: Available time is capped at the amount of time left in the day.
** Deadline: Available time is capped at the amount of time before the assignment is due.

The actual caps placed are as stated above but after accounting for the amount of time already allocated to other assignments in the respective days.

[.text-justify]
Once the user’s schedule is generated, `ScheduleList` is updated with the `allocationResult`, a `CommandResult`
object will be created and returned to `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` returns it to `MainWindow` who
will then retrieve the generated schedule and display it as shown in Fig 10 below.

image::getUi.png[align="center"]
[.text-center]
_Fig 10. Sequence Diagram showing how the generated schedule is retrieved_

[.text-justify]
*Step 4*: Based on the results, the user can then decide on how to best schedule his outing.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Distribution of estimated work hours for each assignment
[.text-justify]
* **Current choice:** Hours are allocated incrementally to achieve a balanced schedule while still ensuring that deadlines can be met (unless impossible due to the constraints of time left)
** Pros: Better reflects the real-world scenario where students are more likely to spread out their work and encourages work life balance which is the main selling point of Naggy Joel.
** Cons: Complicated algorithm is more prone to errors.

[.text-justify]
* **Alternative:** For each day, cumulatively add `Workload/Days to deadline` for all assignments
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Some days may have impossibly high workload, deadlines are not handled properly.

===== Aspect: Variable type to be used for calculations during distribution of workload
[.text-justify]
* **Current choice:** Use of BigDecimal for calculations
** Pros: More accurate allocation of hours while minimizing lost hours due to rounding errors.
** Cons: Harder to handle and new objects have to be created each time.

[.text-justify]
* **Alternative:** Restrict calculations to the use of integer
** Pros: Easier to handle and more accurate comparisons can be made as compared to when floats are used as floating point arithmetic is not exact.
** Cons: A lot of unnecessary ‘loss’ in allocated and available time due to rounding errors.

end::schedule[]

tag::get[]

=== Detailed Contact Viewer
==== Implementation

The detailed contact viewer is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature allows a user to view a particular contact details in entirety.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the get mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial state, which is an empty list.

Step 2. The user executes the `(ab)add n/David p/12345 ...`  command to add a new person.

Step 3. The user executes the `(ab)get 1` command to get the detailed contact of the first person in the AddressBook list.

image::detailedContact.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows how the get operation works within the `Logic` component:

image::getCommand.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: What information to display
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Set a limit on details that has a potential long list (such as NoteTaker) and display them on the detailed contact viewer.
** Pros: All information are displayed for easier viewing/access.
** Cons: AddressBook list might be long and hard to view.
* **Alternative 2:** Display selective information on the AddressBook list and the full information under get command.
** Pros: AddressBook list is less cluttered.
** Cons: Omits certain information.

end::get[]

tag::sortAssgn[]

=== Sorting of Assignments
==== Implementation

The sorting of assignments is facilitated by `AssignmentList`. This feature allows a user to sort assignments by deadline or estimated completion time.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The 'AssignmentList' will be initialized with the initial state, which is an empty list.

Step 2. The user executes the following commands to add new assignments.

* 1. `(st)add t/CS2103 Project d/2020-04-18 23:59 e/180`
* 2. `(st)add t/DBA3702 Project d/2020-04-19 19:00 e/150`
* 3. `(st)add t/CS2106 Lab d/2020-04-11 20:00 e/20`

Step 3. The user executes the `(st)list -d` command to sort the assignments by deadline.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list assignment operation works within the `Logic` component:

image::listAssgnCommand.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to sort assignment by estimated completion time

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Descending order
** Pros: User can prioritise by doing the assignment which takes the longer first.
** Cons: User may spend too much time on assignments that take much longer.
* **Alternative 2:** Ascending order
** Pros: User can clear more assignments faster, by completing those that takes a shorter amount of time first.
** Cons: User may delay starting on assignments that take longer and risk having uncompleted assignments at the deadline.

end::sortAssgn[]

tag::editRestNote[]

=== Editing of Restaurant Notes
==== Implementation

The editing of restaurant notes is facilitated by `RestaurantBook`. This feature allows a user to edit existing notes of a restaurant in the list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the editing of note mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The `RestaurantBook` will be initialized with the initial state, which is an empty list.

Step 2: The user executes the following commands to add notes to a restaurant.

* 1. `(rt)add n/Ameens l/Clementi v/No o/0900:2300 p/$ c/Indian`
* 2. `(rt)addnote r/Cheese fries`

Step 3: The user executes the `(rt)editnote 1 rl/1 r/Butter chicken` command to edit the first recommended food of the restaurant at index 1, to Butter chicken.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit restaurant note operation works within the `Logic` component.

image::addRestNote.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to execute the command for edit note, given 3 editable notes for a restaurant.
* **Alternative 1 (chosen):** Have one command that allows user to choose any note to edit.
** Pros: Easy for user to use, without switching between different commands.
** Cons: As line number of the relevant note needs to be indicated, many levels of checking of the user input is required, and is thus more prone to errors.
* **Alternative 2:** Have 3 separate edit commands, one for each restaurant's note.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: Not user-friendly since different notes cannot be edited in a single command.

end::editRestNote[]

=== Finding Contacts
==== Implementation

The finding of a Person is facilitated by the `Address Book`. This feature allows for users to find a specific contact in their `Address Book`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the finding contact mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application for the first time. The `Address Book` will be initialized with the initial state, which is an empty list.

Step 2: The user executes the `(ab)add n/Joel ...` command multiple times with different details of different people to add multiple people as contacts into the `Address Book`.

Step 3: The user executes the `(ab)find ...` command to find their desired contacts in the AddressBook list. For instance, the user may do:
* `(ab)find o/NUS` searches by organization.
* `(ab)find n/Joel Lim` searches by name.
* `(ab)find t/friends` searches by tags.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works within the `Logic` component.

image::findPersonMain.png[]

image::findPersonRef.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to execute the command for finding a contact using Java Predicates, given that a Person has multiple tags.
Current implementation of Predicates uses the `stream` and `anyMatch` commands to check each keyword against one single word, but since a person may have multiple tags, the implementation needs to be able to check each keyword against multiple tags instead of a single tag.

* **Alternative 1 (chosen):** Concatenate all the tags of a person together into a String, and check the provided tag keywords against that one String.
** Pros: Easier to implement.
** Cons: -
* **Alternative 2:** For each person's unique tags, create one Tag Predicate per tag.
* Pros: Conceptually easier to understand, as well as to draw the UML diagram.
* Cons: Many Tag Predicate objects would have to be created. This could be messy and cause debugging to be difficult.

===== Aspect: How to sort the provided keywords into different Predicates given that there are multiple fields we can search against (eg. Organization, Name, etc)

* **Alternative 1 (chosen):** Have a loop to parse the keywords and sort them into different Predicate keyword lists depending on where the prefixes are located. For instance, if the user types `(ab)find t/friends colleagues o/NUS`, then the keywords `friends` and `colleagues` would to go to the Tag Predicate while the keyword `NUS` would be allocated to the Organization Predicate.
* Pros: Easier for the user because they just have to demarcate which keywords are used for which using a single prefix.
* Cons: More difficult to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Have the user include the prefix before every different keyword they want to search. For instance, if they want to search using 2 different tag keywords like "friends" and "colleagues", they would have to type `(ab)find t/friends t/colleagues`. Then we can use the Argument Multimap to tokenize the arguments.
* Pros: Easier to implement.
* Cons: More troublesome for the user because if they want to search for multiple tags, they would have to keep typing the `/t` prefix for each keyword.

=== Restaurant Book
==== Current Implementation
[.text-justify]
The `RestaurantBook` helps users keep track of `Restaurants`, so that users can quickly find an eating place given their constraints (e.g. odd hours, location, food cravings, etc). We will briefly introduce the implementation and logic behind this component as a stepping stone to understand the `undo/redo` implementation in the next section.

[.text-justify]
The following depicts the class diagram for the `Restaurant` component of the application.

image::rtClassDiagram.PNG[align="center"]

[.text-justify]
Each `Restaurant` has 9 components `Name`, `Location`, `Visit`, `Hours`, `Price`, `Cuisine`, and 3 lists of `Note`s to represent the recommended, good, and bad food that the user can input. `Visit` represents whether the user has visited the restaurant, and `hours` represent the restaurant's opening hours. The other fields are self-explanatory.

We will illustrate how commands to the `RestaurantBook` works using the simple `(rt)add` command, which adds a new `Restaurant` to the `RestaurantBook`.

image::rtAddActivityDiagram.PNG[align="center"]

[.text-justify]
The above shows a medium level abstraction of the activity diagram with swim lanes when the user enters a valid add restaurant command. Even though the command is valid, the parameters might not be, or the restaurant entered might be a duplicate (duplicate iff the name and phone matches). Hence, the corresponding units check for these executing the command.

Once these checks pass, before the `ModelManager` adds the new restaurant in, the `ModelManager` first does some housekeeping to support the `undo/redo` operation as seem in the activity diagram. This is the key we want to illustrate here to better understand `undo/redo`. This is very useful because all commands that change the state will go through a similar process.

=== Undo/Redo
==== Current Implementation
This is the Class Diagram for the `ModelManager` and the `ModelState`, the 2 integral classes to understand the `undo/redo` operations. Note that we have omitted methods used to support other commands but are irrelevant to the `undo/redo` operation and also omitted the getter methods of the `ModelState` for better readability.

The `undo/redo` mechanism is facilitated by modifying `ModelManager` to include 3 additional attributes.
* undoStack: which stores the lists of `ModelState` from which the `undo` operation will draw upon
* redoStack: which stores the lists of `ModelState` from which the `redo` operation will draw upon
* currentModel: which is simply the `ModelState` that the application is currently in

image::ModelManagerClassDiagram.PNG[align="center"]

We will now go through a very simple example of how the `undo/redo` operation is implemented. Assume the following is the initial state:

image::undo(1).PNG[align="center"]

The undo stack is consists of only 1 state, which is the current state. The redo stack will always be empty initially.

image::undo(2).PNG[align="center"]

Suppose the user executes a command to add a new restaurant. The application will then execute a series of commands that is equivalent to duplicating m0, pushing the duplicate into the undo stack, and then making the `currentModel` pointer point to the top of the stack. All changes will then be made to this new duplicate, with the previous state `m0` intact at the bottom of the undo stack. The redo stack still remains empty.

image::undo(3).PNG[align="center"]

Now, suppose the user executes the `undo` command. The application will simply push the current state `m1` into the redo stack, and make the current state pointer point to the resultant top element in the undo stack `m0`, which will be the state before the user entered the last command. The redo stack simply stores all the undone states.

image::undo(3.1).PNG[align="center"]

Now, if the user then executes the `redo` command, the application will simply push the top state `m1` in the redo stack into the undo stack, and make the current state pointer point to the resultant top state in the undo stack again.

image::undo(3.2).PNG[align="center"]

However, suppose if instead of executing the `redo` command, the user executes another command that changes the state such as `(rt)delete 1`, apart from modifying the undo stack as we mentioned earlier when the user executes a command, the redo stack will also be emptied, since there is nothing to redo anymore.

This is a brief summary of how the `undo/redo` operation is implemented. In reality, the type of command that caused the change is also stored in the `ModelState`. This is to ensure that we can display the appropriate visual confirmation in the UI when the user executes an `undo` or `redo` command.

For greater detail, below is the sequence flow diagram when the user executes an `undo` command.

image::undoSequence(1).PNG[align="center"]
image::undoSequence(2).PNG[align="center"]

==== Design Considerations
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
