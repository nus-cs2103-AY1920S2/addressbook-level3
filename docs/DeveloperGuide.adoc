== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`ChatBox`, `ModuleListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `NasaBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a module).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::classDiagramModel.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* consist of two components which are the `NasaBook` and `HistoryManager`.
* `NasaBook` contains all the user current stored modules and activities.
* `HistoryManager` contains all the user previous state for each of it actions.
* `NasaBook` contain a set of module list stored in `UniqueModuleList`.
* each `Module` consists of several `Activity`.
* an `Activity` can be either a `Deadline` or `Event`.
// tag::modelid[]
.Structure of the Activity package of the Model Component
image::ModelActivityDiagram.png[,500,]

From the diagram above, the Activity package consists of the following:

* `ActivityContainsKeyWordsPredicate`: implemented for the `find` command logic.
* The abstract class `UniqueActivityList` is extended by `UniqueDeadlineList` and `UniqueEventList` respectively.
* The abstract class `Activity` is extended by `Deadline` and `Event` respectively. An `Activity` consists of a `Name`, `Date`, `Note`, and `Schedule` (see Figure below).

.Class diagram for Activity
image::ModelActivityClassDiagram.png[,600,]
// end::modelid[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/nasa/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save NASA data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `nasa.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
`Contributed by:EdmondOng`

==== Implementation

For the undo/redo features, we aim to synchronize how the UI will look like and the data that is stored.
Hence, we created two Json files to store the internal data list and the filtered modules and activity list.
We uses Stack as the data structure for undo and redo features as it allows a Last In First Out effects, that suits
functionality of storing and getting data.

Below is a sequence diagram for undo feature.

image::undoSequenceDiagramV2.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire NASA book and state of UI.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Pros: Less repetition of opposite commands.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
** Cons: Maintain the actual looks for UI based on the filtered list.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
** Cons: Storing of the state of UI is still required.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a stack to store the history of NASA book states and UI state based on filtered list.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `Nasa internal list`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Add Deadlines feature

`Contributed by: kester-ng`

Users can add in deadlines into a specific module, the following subsections explains the implementation and design considerations for the feature.

==== Implementation

The following activity diagram shows how a deadline (example) can be added.

image::AddDeadlineActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Internal workings for the add activity command

Below is an example of a user adding a deadline and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters the command `deadline m/CS2030 a/Lab 2 d/12-12-2020 23:59`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create an AddDeadlineCommandParser which parses the input and returns an AddDeadlineCommand.

. LogicManager will execute the AddDeadlineCommand. AddDeadlineCommand will attempt to add the deadline to the specified module. If the module does not exist or the activity already exist in the list, then an error message will be thrown to the user. Else, add it to the module activity list.

. If the module's activity list is modified, the model will be updated and the view will be changed according to the new model.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram on what happens with the simple execution of the aforementioned command. First image shows the logic component while the second image shows the logic and model component (mainly model).

image::AddDeadlineLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

image::AddDeadlineModelSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

The design considerations for the classes are shown below:

[width="59%",cols="22%,<100%,<100%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Choice| Pros:|Cons:
|1.Placing all events and deadlines into one class called Activity|Easy and fast to implement. Very efficient and less dependencies|Bad design, and one class handles the different logic.
|2.Having an abstract Activity class, and events and deadlines all inherit that abstract class|Somewhat easy to implement, polymorphism allows changing of one class without affecting the others.|Attributes can vary for different tasks. Hence additional code may be needed and even duplicated code due to similar logic.
|3.Same as 2, but now each attribute for activity has a separate class [chosen] |Tedious to implement.|Without the classes for attributes, validating whether the attributes are legal needs to be done in the activity class which violates SRP design principle. But now each attribute has its own class with its own validation methods
|=======================================================================

** Choice of design was option 3 as it made all objects separate from one another and allows easy debugging. At the same time, it follows SRP design principle.

// tag::automation[]
=== Automation
`Contributed by:EdmondOng`

Every time a user stores an activity, start date for event will be recorded for `event` and due date for `deadline`.
Based on user input to repeat the task either weekly, twice weekly or monthly, our application will check whether today's date has passed
`due date` or `end date of event`. Once it passed,
the newly set date will be updated.

==== Implementation
By default there will not be any scheduling for any activities. Therefore, user has to enter `repeat-d` or `repeat-e` followed by
`INDEX` of the activity in the module list, followed by `module code`
,and set the activity to `0-Cancel, 1-Weekly-, 2-Twice Weekly, 3-Monthly`.

* An example of command line `repeat-d 1 m/CS3233 r/1`.

Once the command line is entered, our application will react in the following steps :

. NasaBook will search ModelManager for the module code `CS3233`.
. If present, it will search for the activity in the list with index `1`.
. Once identified, it will change the type of schedule to `weekly`.
. A success message `Successfully added a repeat! for CS3233 0 1` will be given.

image::sequenceDiagramAutomationV2.png[]

However, above is for the initialisation of schedule.
What happen if the activity has expired when NasaBook is not in use? Not to worry, because when
the user initialise the program again, the system will automatically reset the expired date.

This is how it goes :

. MainApp will execute initialisation which will fetch data through NasaBookStorage.
. NasaBook will load every module in the module list and update each activity in the module.
. If dateline of the activity has passed, it will check if it has a schedule
.. If scheduler sees `0` nothing will be done.
.. If scheduler sees `1`,`2` or `3` it will update to the new date.

image::activityDiagramAutomationV2.png[]
// end::automation[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort Feature

Activities (ie. Deadlines and Events) are sorted by a specific criteria, such as name or date.

The list of sort criteria are as follows:

. Date

. Lexicographical order

. Priority


Refer to the user guide for the specific commands. Sorting of activities is facilitated by
ModelManager#sortAtivityList.

==== Implementation
To sort activities, the command will use the keyword `sort` followed by the sort criteria.

The following diagram shows how sorting activities is being done.

image::SortActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Internal workings for the sort command

Below is an example of a user sorting activities by name and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters the command `sort name`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create an SortCommandParser which parses the input and return a SortCommand.

. LogicManager will execute the SortCommand. SortCommand will sort all deadlines and events in their respective modules by the criteria specified.

. The underlying model's deadline and event lists is updated.

. The view is updated to the new model.

The figure below shows the sequence diagram on what happens with the execution of the aforementioned command.

image::SortLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

Aspect: Persistence of sort order for CRUD operations.

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Sort order enforced only on demand. (ie. when user invokes `sort` command)
** Pros: Lightweight as sorting is independent of CRUD operations. Performance and responsiveness is not compromised by commonly used CRUD operations.
** Cons: User has to invoke sort command after CRUD operations.
* Alternative 2: Sort order maintained regardless of subsequent CRUD operation on activities.
** Pros: Consistency of list ordering is maintained, as sort order is preserved after CRUD operatons.
** Cons: Performance is hindered as every CRUD operation will require enforcement of sort order on the underlying list data structure, which is computationally expensive. Persistent storage of the user-defined sort order is required, which is harder to implement.
// end::sort[]

=== Statistics Feature (To be implemented)

Statistics on the status of activities based on a specific criteria such as time period is shown. By default, the
overall statistics for all activities are shown.

The list of criteria to be sorted are as follows:

. Overall

. Module

. Activity type

. Time (Weekly/Monthly/Yearly)

Refer to the user guide for the specific commands. Generating statistics is facilitated by
ModelManager#calculateStatistics.

==== Implementation
To generate statistics for activities, the command will use the keyword `statistics` followed by a specific criteria.

==== Internal workings for the statistics command

Below is an example of a user requesting for statistics by for the week and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters the command `statistics t/week`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create an StatisticsCommandParser which parses the input and returns an StatisticsCommand.

. LogicManager will execute the StatisticsCommand. StatisticsCommand will calculate the number of tasks and their
current status for each module over the past week.

. The view is switched to the statistics tab to display the overalls statistics for the week.

=== Calendar Export Feature
This feature allows the current calendar view to be exported as a ics file for other calendars to import.
Users can choose to either export it to the default ./data filepath or specify their own filepath for the file to be exported to.

==== Internal Workings for the Calendar Export Feature

`Contributed by: kester-ng`

Below is an example of a user requesting an export calendar command.

. The user enters the command `calendar f/User/documents/calendar`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create ExportCalendarCommandParser which parses the input and creates a ExportCalendarCommand.

. ExportCalendarCommand will then execute. In the first step, all the deadlines and events are retrieved from the model.

. Next, each deadline or event are being used to create new IcsDeadline or IcsEvent respectively. These new objects are the representation of their respective activities in ics format (using getIcsFormat() method).

. Deadlines are represented by `VTODO` objects in ics file and events are represented by `VEVENT` objects.

. While creating IcsDeadline or IcsEvent, IcsSchedules are created if the deadline or event has a auto-generation indicator (ie generate every week). The IcsSchedule object is appended to the IcsDeadline/IcsEvent object to allow it to auto-generate in calendars.

. Once all IcsDeadlines and IcsEvents are created, the command will then write all the ics Formatted activities to the file called `nasa.ics` at the filepath.

The image below indicates the activity diagram giving a brief flow of events occurring.

image::ExportCalendarActivityDiagram.png[]

The images below show the sequence diagram of the export calendar command feature. The first image mainly illustrates the flow for parsing and creating the command whereas the second mainly illustrates the flow for executing the command and returning the result.

image::ExportCalendarLogicSequenceDiagram.png[]

image::ExportCalendarModelSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

The design considerations for the classes are shown below:

[width="59%",cols="22%,<100%,<100%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Choice| Pros:|Cons:
| Having a single class that encapsulates the whole logic of writing to ICS format | Easy and fast to implement. | Code will be very messy and if there are updates to iCalendar formats, it may cause a huge refactoring of code
| Instead of exporting ics file, can export the image of calendar | Easier to implement and fast and with no issues relating to certain calendars not supporting VTODO. | However, it is not very convenient. Images can only show one month at a time.
| [Currently implemented] Have different classes for representing different activities with helper classes to assist in generating ics rules | Harder to implement and makes it very tedious. | Easy to debug and change when there are updates to the .ics format
|=======================================================================

** Option 3 was chosen as having different classes allowed us to pinpoint the exact error when the ics file was not working as intended. And any extensions or upgrades to iCalendar format can be easily extended from the current code without refactoring a lot. However, drawback is that some calendars do not support `VTODO`.

=== Chat bot Feature (To be implemented)

The CLI implementation is done through a chat bot like interface through a redesign of the user interface.

==== Implementation
The user interface is split into 2 sections where commands will be keyed into the chat box on the left side. Feedback
from the programme on the result of the command will be displayed directly by the chat bot where the command history
can be viewed. Changes made to the model will be updated in the user interface on the right side

==== Internal workings for the chat bot

Below is an example of a user requesting for statistics by for the week and how the underlying system works.

. The user enters a command `statistics`

. The NASA application will process the command. (Refer to section 3.8 for details)

. Command result generated by the logic manager is returned and displayed in the chat bot.

. User interface switches tabs to the statistics tab where the overall statistics are displayed.

// tag::quote[]
=== Motivational Quotes
`Contributed by: EdmondOng`
Given our hectic education lifestyle, we tend to neglect the emotional aspect of what makes life purposeful other than academic works.
This features randomly select a quote and displayed to user on start-up of application. It aims to lighten the mood of the user.

==== Implementation
On the first start-up of application, Nasa will store all the quotes inside a text file in the data folder. If the quotes file is
already present, it will carry on with selecting one of the quote to be displayed to the user. At any point of time, if you wish to see
another motivation quote, you can type `quote`.

==== Internal workings for the motivation quote.

. User enters a command `quote`.
. NASA will generate a random number and select a quote in quotes.txt file.
. Command result generated will be displayed to the user.
// end::quote[]

=== Add Reminder Feature (Coming in `v2.0`)

Reminders can be added to activities so that the user can be notified when the activity is going to occur soon.

Below is an example of how users can add reminders:

. The user enters the reminder command: `reminder 2 m/CS2030 d/12-12-2020 14:50`

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create AddReminderCommandParser that parses the input and returns a AddReminderCommand.

. LogicManager will then execute AddReminderCommand which will create a Reminder item that contains the Activity and the date to be reminded.

. The Reminder item will be added into the `ActiveRemindersList`. In addition, the reminders are sorted based on chronological order.

. The reminder list view will be updated to show the current `ActiveRemindersList`.

. If the time for any reminder has reached, there will be a pop-up or notification to alert the user for about 1min. And within 5 minutes, the reminder will automatically be removed from `ActiveRemindersList` and stored in the `PastRemindersList`.

For more information regarding the procedure, please refer to the Activity Diagram shown below.

image::AddReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

For more information regarding the structure of the feature, refer to the class diagram below:

image::AddReminderClassDiagram.png[]

=== Snooze Reminder Feature (Coming in `v2.0`)

Users can also snooze reminders so that they can get the same reminder at a different time.

Below is an example of how users can snooze reminders:

. The user enters the snooze reminder command: `snooze 2 d/12-12-2020 15:30`.

. The LogicManager will create NasaBookParser to parse the user input.

. NasaBookParser will create SnoozeReminderCommandParser to parse the input and return SnoozeReminderCommand

. LogicManager will execute the command and the Reminder that has just passed with the associated index on the `ActiveRemindersList` will have its due time updated. If time not specified, default is 5 minutes.

For more information regarding the procedure, please refer to the Activity Diagram below:

image::SnoozeReminderActivityDiagram.png[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
