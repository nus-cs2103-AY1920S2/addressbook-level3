== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.svg[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -o 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete -o 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `OrderBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a new order).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -o 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -o 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.svg[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Order Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Order>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
An Order class consists of nine different fields as shown in the image. Every order is part of a UniqueOrderList and
every UniqueOrderList is part of an OrderBook.
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.svg[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.svg[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save both OrderBook and ReturnOrderBook data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Clear feature
The clear feature allows the user to remove the orders and return orders by input one command line.

The clear feature was implemented as a `ClearCommand` in the `Logic` package. +

==== Class Diagram for Clear feature
.Clear Class Diagram
image::ClearClassDiagram.svg[]

==== Sequence Diagram for clearing both order book and return order book
The sequence diagram for the *Clear Command* is shown below: +

.Clear Command Sequence Diagram
image::ClearCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments passed to the Clear Command will be parsed by the `ClearCommandParser` class +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `ClearCommand` object will be returned.

In the `ClearCommandParser`, there will be two validation checks: +
1. The flag is one of the three flags: `-f`, `-o` and `-r`. +
2. The arguments do not have both `-o` and `-r` flags.

After the `ClearCommand` object is being returned to the `LogicManager`, the `LogicManager` will start
to run the execute the clear Command, this is will be shown diagram below.

==== Execution of Clear Command Sequence Diagram

.Execution of Clear Command Sequence Diagram
image::ClearCommandSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

The `execute(model)` function of the `ClearCommand` will have the 6 following sequences: +
1. `-o` flag and `-f` flag found in flags: Pass a new `OrderBook` to `model`. +
2. `-r` flag and `-f` flag found in flags: Pass a new `ReturnOrderBook` to `model`. +
3. Only `-f` flag found in flags: Pass a new `ReturnOrderBook` and a new `OrderBook` to `model`. +
4. Only `-o` flag found in flags: Pass the confirmation message for clearing the `OrderBook` to `CommandResult`. +
5. Only `-r` flag found in flags: Pass the confirmation message for clearing the `ReturnOrderBook` to `CommandResult`. +
6. No flag found in flags: Pass the confirmation message for clearing both `OrderBook` and `ReturnOrderBook` to `CommandResult`. +

After executing any of the sequences above, a new `CommandResult` object will be return back to `LogicManager`.


=== Delete feature
The delete feature allows the user to delete orders in either the order list or return order list.

The delete feature was implemented as a `DeleteCommand` in the `Logic` package. +


=== Delivered feature
The delivered feature allows the user to mark orders as delivered after delivering an order.

The delivered feature was implemented as a `DoneCommand` in the `Logic` package. +

==== Class Diagram for Done feature
image::DoneClassDiagram.svg[]

==== Sequence Diagram for delivering an order
The sequence diagram for the *Delivered Command* is shown below.

image::DoneSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments passed to the Done Command will be parsed by the `DoneCommandParser` class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `DoneCommand` object will be returned.
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a `ParseException`. +
Two types of invalid arguments are checked for: empty arguments
and arguments with only whitespace characters.

The `execute()` function of the `DoneCommand` will first check if the given arguments
are in the format required for an order to be marked as complete
(i.e. both the command word `return` and `INDEX` are present)
The check is done within the `execute()` function. +

If the input is valid, the particular order based on the integer `INDEX` will be used to +
obtain this order from the order book. This order will be checked if it was delivered. +

1. If it was not delivered, it will trigger the `setOrder()`, `deliverOrder()`
and `updateFilteredOrderList()` functions. These methods will be used to replace
the existing order with the new order that has a delivered status. Also, the order book
will be updated to show the change. +

2. If the order was delivered, it will only trigger the `updateFilteredOrderList()` function which will
display the original order book.

=== Nearby feature
In this section, you will learn more about how the `nearby` feature is implemented.

==== What is the Nearby feature
The nearby feature allows the user to view all orders that are located at a particular area
based on a given search criteria. +

The nearby feature was implemented as a `NearbyCommand` in the `Logic` package. +

The `nearby` command has two possible formats: +

1. `nearby` `FLAG` `POSTAL_SECTOR`
2. `nearby` `FLAG` `AREA`

[NOTE]
====
1. `FLAG` is an optional argument and indicates which order list to search on. +
It can be either `-o` or `-r`.
A `-o` `FLAG` argument indicates that the order list will be searched. +
A `-r` `FLAG` argument indicates that the return order list will be searched. +
By default, if no `FLAG` arguments are provided, both order list and return order list will be searched.

2. Searching of nearby orders is done by either `POSTAL_SECTOR` or `AREA` +

* A `POSTAL_SECTOR` refers to the first *two* digits of a six digit Singapore postal code. +
The list of postal sectors and their corresponding general locations can be found
https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/resources/misc/list_of_postal_districts.htm[on this website]. +

* An `AREA` refers to one of the five areas of Singapore:
** Central
** East
** North East
** West
** North
** You can obtain more detailed information about each area from
https://keylocation.sg/singapore/districts-map[this website]
====


==== Execution paths of Nearby command
In this section, you will learn more about the execution paths for the `nearby` command.

.Nearby Command Activity Diagram
image::NearbyActivityDiagram.svg[]

There are four possible execution paths for the `nearby` command

1. User provides an invalid `nearby` command input +
This results in a parse exception +
2. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has no flags +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for all lists (order list and return order list) +
3. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has one flag. This flag indicates the order list (`-o`) +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for the order list.
4. User provides a valid `nearby` command input that has one flag. This flag indicates the return order list (`-r`) +
All matching nearby orders will be shown for the return order list.

The matching orders are determined based on the given user argument. +
If a two digit integer is given, searching of nearby orders will be based on their postal sector. +
Else, searching of nearby orders will be based on their area. +
There are currently five areas that are searchable:

1. Central
2. East
3. North-East
4. West
5. North

==== Structure of Nearby command
In this section, you will learn more about the relationships between objects
related to the `nearby` command.

.Nearby Command Class Diagram
image::NearbyClassDiagram.svg[]

In the `NearbyCommand` class, there are also static strings present that represent the
various possible messages. +
For some of the message strings, there are placeholder %s strings used for including dynamic input +
These messages are the following:

1. `MESSAGE_USAGE` +
nearby: View all orders located at the same postal sector based on the displayed list. +
Parameters: [FLAG] POSTAL_SECTOR or AREA +
An optional flag may be given to indicate the list to be searched for. +
The flag can be either -o for orders for -r for return orders +
A postal sector is the first two digits of a six digit Singapore postal code +
An area is one of the following: Central, East, North-East, West, North +
Example: nearby -o 14 +
Example: nearby -r central +
Example: nearby east +
2. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_POSTAL_SECTOR` +
Displayed all orders in postal sector. +
General Location: %1$s +
3. `MESSAGE_SUCCESS_AREA` +
Displayed all orders in area (%s) +
4. `MESSAGE_FAILURE_POSTAL_SECTOR` +
Invalid postal sector given. +
5. `MESSAGE_FAILURE_AREA` +
Invalid area given. +


==== Interactions between Nearby command and its associated objects
In this section, you will learn more about the `nearby` command and its inner workings.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby` `-o` `14`. +
This indicates that the order list should be operated on and
all orders in the order list that have a `POSTAL_SECTOR` of `14`
should be displayed to the user.


.Nearby Command Sequence Diagram for `nearby` `-o` `14`
image::NearbyCommandSequenceDiagram1.svg[]

The arguments passed to the Nearby Command will be parsed by the `NearbyCommandParser` class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `NearbyCommand` object will be returned. +
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a `ParseException`. +
Two types of invalid arguments are checked for: empty arguments
and arguments with only whitespace characters.

The `execute()` function of the `NearbyCommand` will first check if the given arguments
are in the format required for postal sector search (the argument can be converted into an integer).
If the first check is successful, the argument will be converted into an integer and
a second check is performed via the `isValidPostalSector(Index postalSector)` function
of the `NearbyCommandUtil` helper class.

[NOTE]
====
`NearbyCommandUtil` is a helper class that contains functions and variables used for
identifying postal sectors and their corresponding general locations. +
This class was created to reduce the responsibility of the `NearbyCommand` class. +

* A `HashMap` was used to store information about postal sectors and their respective general locations.
====

The `model` will then be updated by the `updateFilteredOrderList(orderPredicate)` function. +

A `CommandResult` is then generated and returned to the `LogicManager`.


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby` `-o` `central`. +
This indicates that the order list should be operated on and
all orders in the order list that have an `AREA` of `central`
should be displayed to the user.

.Nearby Command Sequence Diagram of `nearby` `-o` `central`
image::NearbyCommandSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

The `NearbyCommandParser` will check for invalid arguments given by the user. +
Invalid arguments can be either empty arguments or arguments with
only whitespace characters.
A `ParseException` will be generated if an invalid argument is present.

A new `NearbyCommand` will be created and returned to `LogicManager`.

`LogicManager` will then call the `execute()` function of the `NearbyCommand`. +
There will then be a check for whether the given argument is a valid area with the
function `isValidArea(area)` present in the `DistrictInfo` class.

[NOTE]
====
`DistrictInfo` is a helper class that contains functions and variables used for
identifying areas. +
This class was created to reduce the responsibility of the `NearbyCommand` class. +
====

The model will then be updated using the `updateFilteredOrderList(orderPredicate)` function.

A new `CommandResult` will be created and returned to the `LogicManager`.


The sequence diagram below shows the interactions for a `nearby` command execution of
`nearby`. +
This will result in a `ParseException` as invalid arguments are provided.

.Nearby Command Sequence Diagram of `nearby`
image::NearbySequenceDiagramParseException.svg[]

The exception will be thrown in the `NearbyCommandParser`.


[[import]]
=== Import feature
The import feature allows users to save the trouble of adding the delivery orders and the return orders one by one
when they have large amount of delivery orders or return orders to add into Delino.

The import feature was implemented as a `ImportCommand` in the `Logic` package.

==== Class Diagram for Import feature:

.Import Command Class Diagram
image::ImportClassDiagram.svg[]

==== Sequence Diagram for importing the csv file.
The sequence diagram for the *Import Command* when import the data from the  *csv file*
is shown below:

.Import Command Sequence Diagram
image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

The arguments passed to the Import Command will be parsed by the `ImportCommandParser` class. +
If the given arguments are valid, a new `ImportCommand` object will be returned.
In this class, invalid arguments will result in a `ParseException`. +

Two types of checks will be done before returning the `ImportCommand`:

1. Check whether the file is exists in the data folder.
2. Check whether the first prefix is `orderType` prefix.

[NOTE]
====
`CsvProcessor` is  a helper class that helps to retrieve the data from the csv file and process the data before
giving to `ImportCommand`.
====

After the `ImportCommand` object is being returned to the `LogicManager`, the `LogicManager` will start
to run the execute the `ImportCommand`, this is will be shown at the diagram below.

==== Execution of Import Command Sequence Diagram

.Execution of Import Command Sequence Diagram
image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

The `execute(model)` function of the `ImportCommand` will first check if the data given starts with
*order* or *return* and pass to the `InsertCommandParser` or `ReturnCommandParser` respectively. +

Afterwards, `InsertCommandParser` or `ReturnCommandParser` will return the `InsertCommand` or `ReturnCommand` respective
if it successfully parse the data. The `ImportCommand` will then call the `execute(Model)` function of `InsertCommand`
or `ReturnCommand`. This will cause a delivery order or return order being added into the `Model`.

The `ImportCommand` will call its own `printResult()` function and return a String message to the `CommandResult` object
which is then pass back to the `LogicManager`.
**
[[search]]
=== Search feature
The search function allow users to search for any orders according to the provided input. +
There are two mode of searching, *general search* or *specific search*. +
If the user does not provide any `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`, a *general search* mode will be performed. +

* *General search* will search for all fields in an order and return orders that have any matching fields. +

If the user provide any `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`, a *specific search* will be performed. +

* *Specific search* will search orders based on the given `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>`.

==== Class Diagram for Search feature:

.Search Command Class Diagram
image::SearchCommandClassDiagram.png[]

==== Sequence Diagram for Search feature:

The sequence diagram for the *Search Command* when searching for any orders that contain *Alice* in any of it's field is shown below:

.Search Command Sequence Diagram
image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram.svg[]

LogicManager first calls `parseCommand` with arguments representing the user input, `Alice`. The `SearchCommandParser` will then check for any invalid arguments passed by the user. +

[TIP]
====
* If the given arguments are valid, `SearchCommandParser` will return  a new `SearchCommand` object. +
* If the given arguments are invalid or empty, a `ParseException` object will be thrown (not shown in the diagram).
====

Upon validation of the arguments, `SearchCommandParser` will call for the `tokenize` static method in `ArgumentTokenizer` to get an `ArgumentMultimap` object containing all the user input keywords.
Each keyword will be stored in the `ArgumentMultimap` object to it's corresponding prefix.
If no prefix is given, `ArgumentMultimap` will store the user input as a value tagged to an empty string key; the empty string key is referred to as the *preamble*. +

Using the `ArgumentMultimap` object, `SearchCommandParser` will check if the preamble is empty. +
If the preamble is not empty, a *general search* will be performed in which the `SearchCommandParser` will call the
`OrderContainsKeywordsPredicate` constructor. The constructor accepts the user input as a parameter (`keyword`). +
If the preamble is empty, `SearchCommandParser` will call the overloaded constructor of `OrderContainsKeywordsPredicate`, passing the pre-processed user input as `keyword` and the `ArgumentMultimap`. +

For both scenarios, `OrderContainsKeywordsPredicate` object will be returned to `SearchCommandParser`. After which, a new instance of `SearchCommand` object will be created and returned back to the `LogicManager` through `OrderBookParser`.

.Search Command Sequence Diagram 2
image::SearchCommandSequenceDiagram2.svg[]

After which, the `LogicManager` will then call the `execute` function of `SearchCommand` object passing a `model` object as an argument. +
The `model` will then update the list of shown orders using the `OrderContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.

Lastly, a new `CommandResult` object will be created and returned to the `LogicManager`.


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
