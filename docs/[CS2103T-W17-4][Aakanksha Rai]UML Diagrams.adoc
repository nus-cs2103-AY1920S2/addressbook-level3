=== Aakanksha Rai - UML Diagrams

Some sections from the explanations have been removed from this document in order
to fit the page requirement. Please read the Developer Guide for more detailed
explanations.

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the
functioning of the *Student View*.

.Student View - Class Diagram
image::ModuleModelClassDiagram.png[,450]

In the diagram above, you can see that:

* The `TaTracker` class contains a `UniqueModuleList` which helps it keep track
of the different *modules* the user is teaching.

* Each `Module` contains a `UniqueGroupList`. Each `UniqueGroupList` contains a list
of all the *groups of a module* that the user
is teaching.

* Each `Group` contains a `UniqueStudentsList` that contains the *students in that group*.

Since the `Sort` commands function differently but use a single parser,
the structure shown in the following
_Class Diagram_ is used.

.Sort Commands - Class Diagram
image::SortCommandsClassDiagram.png[,300]

Since the different commands use the same parser,
the `SortCommandParser` needs to check the sub-command word and return
the appropriate sort command.

The following _Activity Diagram_ shows the steps the `SortCommandParser` takes once
its _parse_ method is called (assuming that no exception is thrown).

.SortCommandParser - Activity Diagram

The following _Sequence Diagram_ illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and
`Model` components when the user enters the command `sort all t/matric`.

.Sort - Sequence Diagram

[NOTE]
====
* The `SortCommandParser`, which creates `Sort` commands, is different from the other
command parsers. While the other commands have another level of parsing (such as the
`ModuleCommandParser` for `Module` commands), the `SortCommandParser`
creates all the different Sort commands within itself.
====

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a *sort command* and passes the
command to the `SortCommandParser`.

3. The `SortCommandParser` performs the steps shown in the previous activity diagram
and determines that since the sub-command word is `all` , it must create and return a
`SortCommand`.

4. `LogicManager` calls `SortCommand#execute()`.

5. `SortCommand` checks the type of sorting that is indicated. Since the sort type
is `matric` , it calls `Model#sortModulesByMatricNumber()` command.

6. The `SortCommand` returns a `CommandResult` with a success message.

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the interactions
between the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the
command `module add m/CS2103 n/Software Engineering`.

.Module Add - Sequence Diagram
image::AddModuleSequenceDiagram.png[,1000]

1. `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that this command is a *module command* and passes the
command to the `ModuleCommandParser`.

3. The `ModuleCommandParser` sees that this command is an *add command* and passes the
arguments to the `AddModuleCommandParser`.

4. The `AddModuleCommandParser` creates a `Module` with the given module code and
name.

5. The `AddModuleCommandParser` then creates an `AddModuleCommand` object with a newly
created module. The parser then returns the `AddModuleCommand` object.

6. `LogicManager` calls `AddModuleCommand#execute()`.

7. The `AddModuleCommand` object
checks whether a module with the given module code already exists in *TA-Tracker*

.. If it does, a *command exception is thrown* saying that a module with the given module
code already exists in the *TA-Tracker*.

.. If no such module exists, the *module is added to the TA-Tracker*.

8. The `AddModuleCommand` returns a `CommandResult`.

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline of a class in a Sequence Diagram should end at the destroy marker(X).
However, due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.
