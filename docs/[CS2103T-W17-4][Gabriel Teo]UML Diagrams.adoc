==== Logic Component

The following _Class Diagrams_ show a break down of the `Logic` component at different levels of abstraction.

.Structure of the Logic Component

[[Fig-Right]]
.Logic Component - Organization of commands and parsers
image::LogicClassDiagram2.png[,400]
|====

<<Fig-Left, The _Class Diagram_ on the left>> shows the highest level of abstraction in the `Logic` component:

* `LogicManager` is the main driver class of the `Logic` component.
* The `Command` class and `Parser` interface are in their own packages.
* The `Logic` component interacts with other components.

<<Fig-Left, The _Class Diagram_ on the right>> shows a clear relationship between *parsers* and *commands*.

==== Syntax Highlighting

This feature applies syntax highlighting on the user input whenever it changes in the `CommandBox`.

<<Fig-Left, The _Class Diagram_ on the left>> shows the important classes in the `UI` and `Logic` components
that are used in the _Syntax Highlighting_ feature.
|====

The following _Activity Diagrams_ outline each step of the _Syntax Highlighting_ feature.

[NOTE]
====
* The `full command word` is the first few words of the user input that identifies the command that the user wants to execute.
* An `argument` contains a `prefix` and a `value`. Each command is made up of many arguments.
* The `preamble` is everything (including whitespaces) between the `full command word` and the first `argument` in the user's input.

[[Fig-1]]
.Step 1 - Highlighting a new input
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram1.png[,330]
|
<<Fig-1, The _Activity Diagram_ on the left>> shows how the `full command word` is highlighted,
up until the beginning of the `preamble`.

There should be a _rake symbol_ next to the *bolded* activity: *Highlight arguments*.
|
[[Fig-2]]
.Step 2 - Highlighting the preamble
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram2.png[,330]
|
<<Fig-2, The _Activity Diagram_ on the left>> shows how the `preamble` is highlighted,
up until the beginning of the first `argument`.

There should be a _rake symbol_ next to the *bolded* activities: *Highlight invalid arguments*.
|
[[Fig-3]]
.Step 3 - Highlighting the remaining arguments
image::SyntaxHighlightingActivityDiagram3.png[,330]
|
<<Fig-3, The _Activity Diagram_ on the left>> explains how each `argument` is highlighted,
up until end of the user input.

==== Student Commands

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows how `Student` objects are removed from the TA-Tracker
when the `DeleteStudentCommand` is executed.

[[Fig-Student]]
.Student Delete - Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png[,1000]

<<Fig-Student, In the _Sequence Diagram_ above>>,

* Each *parser* extracts the command's parameters from the user's input.
* A `DeleteStudentCommand` is created at the end of a chain of *parsers*.
* A `DeleteStudentCommand` then interacts with the `Model` to check that student with the matric number exists in the provided group and module,
before finally removing the student.
