== About the Project

HireLah! is targeted to bring greater convenience to interviewers who can type quickly and prefer typing over mouse +
commands. Additionally, we included customised features in our desktop apps to help interviewers to manage interviews.

=== My Role

My role was to create the building blocks of the components of HireLah! such as the attribute, questions, metrics,
etc. I have also contributed in creating the CRUD commands for attributes, questions, and metrics. I have also created
for the Find Best Interviewees feature. The section that follows the document will follow in more detailed discussion.

I have also made notable contributions to the User Guide and Developer Guide.

Listed in the table below are some notations that are used throughout the document.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement #1*: Implemented *create, update, and delete* feature for attributes, questions, and metrics
** What it does: It allows the user to perform create, update, and delete commands for attributes, questions, and metrics
as fundamental components in interviewing and assessing the capabilities of the interviewees.

** Justification: It enables the users to take note of which attributes that they want to find in the interviewees they
want to interview, questions that would like to be asked, as well as the metrics that could be used as a parameter to
systematically rank the interviewees.
** Highlights: This enhancement is an upgrade of the existing commands from the initial codebase.

* *Major enhancement #2*: Implemented *Find Best N Interviewees* feature
** What it does: It allows users to list the best N interviewees in the decreasing order, based on a certain parameter,
or overall score.
** Justification: It enables users to determine the top N interviewees that the interviewer wants to hire, either based
on overall score, a particular attribute, or even a weighted score.
** Highlights: This enhancement is relatively challenging, since it is a whole new feature that requires a well-designed
strategy to execute the plan.

* *Major enhancement #3*: Implemented *Load Attributes and Questions from other Session* feature
** What it does: It allows users to load attributes and questions from other sessions
** Justification: It provides a convenience for the user when the user has multiple sessions with the same attributes and questions.
Instead of starting from scratch, the user can add all the attributes and questions in one session, and load from this session
for the rest.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires some time to do it because it involves both Model and Storage to obtain the attributes
and questions from the other sessions, which are managed by the Storage, before copying it to the Model.
