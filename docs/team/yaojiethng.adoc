== PROJECT: JelphaBot

'''

== Overview

JelphaBot is a desktop application to help NUS students manage tasks.
JelphaBot allows students to track and manage tasks conveniently.
Users enter commands in JelphaBot through a CLI. However, a GUI is implemented with JavaFX for a smoother user experience.
It is written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.

== About this portfolio

This portfolio lists my individual contributions to the JelphaBot.
It includes a summary of the feature enhancements implemented and contribution to the User Guide and Developer Guide.
It also details other contributions I made throughout the duration of the project to team-based tasks.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability for users to *group their tasks by time or module code*, as well as *provided interfaces for other developers to implement new grouping categories*.
** What it does: allows users to change the way their tasks are listed by switching between a list that shows:
*** Tasks listed by how soon their due date is to the current date.
*** Tasks listed by their Module Code.
** *Justification*: Task management is the core feature of JelphaBot.
This feature improves the task management process significantly because it allows users to see at first glance their most urgent or important tasks.
** *Highlights*:
*** This feature involves full-stack development in `Logic`, `Model`, `Storage` and `Ui` components.
*** As all other features use `Task` as the underlying Model entity, there was high coupling with features implemented by other groupmates.
*** This enhancement affected existing commands as `GroupedTaskList` listed showed tasks in a different order from the underlying list stored in the model, and this order would vary depending on the `Category` displayed.
*** It required model objects to be queried from the displayed index in `Ui` instead of the the default order in `Model` (which was the order in which objects were implemented).

*** The implementation was challenging as it required changes to be made to existing commands while still reducing conflict with other teammates' work.
This required many design alternatives to be considered.
*** All non-User-Interface classes added were backed up with tests.
