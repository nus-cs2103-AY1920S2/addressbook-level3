== PROJECT: Coupon Stash

image::Ui.png[width="600"]

== Overview

Coupon Stash is a desktop coupons manager that allows users to keep track of
their coupons. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a beautiful
GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo and redo operations* (Pull
request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/91[#91],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/135[#135],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/284[#284])
** What it does: allows the user to undo the most recent operation on the
coupon stash. Undoing can itself be undone via the redo operation.
** Justification: This feature is essential in allowing users who've made
mistakes in their operations on the coupon stash to revert their changes.
Addtionally, users will also want to be able to revert to their reverted
changes, and this led to the creation of the undo and redo commands.
** Highlights: This enhancement required the deep copy of all a coupon's
fields so as to prevent unpredictable side effects down the line. Thus,
there was constant collaboration and communication with the group members
regarding how to best tie in this feature with the rest of the features.
Some new commands added by other group members also require updates to
be pushed to the undo and redo feature, thus this was a very dynamic
feature that needed frequent updates.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to share coupons as images* (Pull
request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/176[#176],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/384[#384])
** What it does: allows the user to share their coupons as an image file.
** Justification: In the 21st century where everyone seems to post every
thing on social media, the ability for users to share their coupons as a
format ripe for social media consumption is of upmost importance. This
feature allows users to share their coupons in a portable format for sharing
over various platforms.
** Highlights: This enhancement required the rendering of a `CouponCard` in a
`Scene`, before we proceed to take a `snapshot` of the `CouponCard`. The main
challenge came when trying to save the `WritableImage` returned by `snapshot`
as a `.png` file. To perform that task, an external module
(`javax.imageio.ImageIO`) had to be requested to be used. Then, the image
needed a save dialog to be saved. Due to file operations having potential for
many errors, exceptions has to be caught and thrown and multiple error
messages were also created to best reflect an error.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to open an offline copy of the user
guide* (Pull
request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/201[#201],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/284[#284],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/385[#385])
** What it does: allows the user to open an offline copy of the user guide in
their web browser with the `help` command.
** Justification: While the help tab exists, the help tab only shows
information about the commands. Much more of the program's functionality is
available in the user guide, and with the program being an offline
application, it is thus very useful for the user to be able to read the user
guide offline. This will empower users to fully exploit the potential of our
program.
** Highlights: The user guide is stored as a single `.html` file with
all styles and images embed into that single ~6 MB file.
The file has to be packaged into the release jar file,
before it gets extracted from the jar file on the first time the `help`
command is executed. It was a challenge to reliably get the path of the jar
file. (We need the path to extract the `.html` from the jar) After figuring
out how to get the jar file path during runtime, we had to extract the
`.html` file from within the jar file and then write it to the directory the
jar file resides. Initially, writing to a file was very slow and it would
even make the program crash sometimes! Then, I remembered what I learnt from
CS2106 and realised that a buffered writing operation will reduce system
calls and thus be faster. And lo and behold, after the implementation of a
write buffer, writing speeds got a lot faster. (now it only takes one second)
* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate
to previous commands using up/down keys. (Pull
request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/135[#135],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/140[#140])
* *Minor enhancement*: added a sort command that allows the user to sort
coupons by the names, expiry dates, and remind dates in ascending order. (Pull
request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/140[#140],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/284[#284])
* *Minor enhancement*: worked on the expand command. (Pull request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/375[#375])
* *Minor enhancement*: wrote the logic for the Help Pane. (Pull request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/215[#215])
* *Minor enhancement*: improved and cleaned up the remind command. (Pull request
