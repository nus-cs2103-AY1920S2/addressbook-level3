== PROJECT: Cooking Papa

'''

== Overview

CookingPapa acts is an application targeted towards university students that want to learn how to cook by themselves. Users will interact with the application with a CLI, integrated with a GUI created with JavaFX. It acts as storage for recipes, keeps track of an inventory of your current ingredients and also has a shopping list to remind users what to buy on their next trip to the supermarket.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Cart move to inventory
** What it does: With one command, the user is able to migrate all the ingredients from the cart to the inventory. From there, the inventory will
be updated with the added ingredients and the cart will be empty.
** Justification: This enhancement will allow the user to skip the need to update their own inventory after their shopping trip. Instead of having
to keep track what ingredients they have to add from cart to the inventory and eventually delete everything in the cart, this command will do it all in
one line.
** Highlights: This command will be frequently used, since cart serves as a convenient shopping list for our users. After shopping, it is common to
update your inventory of ingredients and this feature can accomplish this need easily.
** Credits: Ingredient checks and tests are a group effort. The whole team contributed in allowing the `Ingredient` class to be built well, which
is a key part of our project.


* *Minor enhancement*: Adding an ingredient to the cart
** What it does: Allows the user to add an ingredient with a specified quantity into the cart. If the ingredient name already exists, it
adds on to the quantity of the ingredient in the cart (Provided that the unit given in the quantity is the same).
** Justification: This feature allows the user to add ingredients to the cart so that they can be reminded of what to but at their next trip to the
supermarket.
** Highlights: This enhancement allows users to choose the number of ingredients they would actually need to complete their recipe. For example.
if the recipe calls for 3 eggs while the user only has 1 in their inventory, they can simply add 2 more manually into the cart.
** Credits: Ingredient checks and tests are a group effort. The whole team contributed in allowing the `Ingredient` class to be built well, which
is a key part of our project.

=== Cart Commands http://github.com/tzihiang[(by Tay Zi Hiang Willis)]
Cart commands are commands that allow you to easily add ingredients needed for a recipe
into a shopping cart. This provides convenience for your grocery shopping needs.

==== Add ingredients in a recipe to the cart
This command allows you to add all the ingredients in a recipe to the cart.

- Format: `cart add recipe INDEX`
- Example:
|===
| Command | Result

|`cart add recipe 1`
|Adds all the ingredients required of recipe 1 to the cart.
|===

==== Add ingredients to the cart
This command allows you to add ingredients to the cart.

- Format: `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT q/QUANTITY`
- Example:
|===
| Command | Result

|`cart add ingredient i/Eggs q/5`
|Adds 5 eggs to the cart.
|===


==== Remove ingredients from the cart
This command allows you to remove ingredients from the cart.
You can indicate the quantity you want to remove for an ingredient, which should not be greater that than the
ingredient's quantity.
Please ensure that the unit of the quantity matches the ingredient's unit in the cart.

Note: If you do not indicate any quantity, all entries in the cart that have the specified ingredient name will be removed
regardless of the unit.

- Format: `cart remove ingredient i/INGREDIENT [q/QUANTITY]`
- Example:
|===
| Command | Result
|`cart remove ingredient i/Eggs`
|Removes all eggs from the cart
|`cart remove ingredient i/Milk q/200ml`
|Removes 200ml of milk from the cart.
_(If your cart had 500 ml of milk, it will be subtracted and updated to 300 ml of milk)_
|===

==== Clear all the items in the cart
This command allows you to clear all the items in the cart. It can be used to discard an unwanted cart,
or to clear the cart after completing the purchase.

- Format: `cart clear`
- Example:
|===
| Command | Result

|`cart clear`
|Clears the cart of all items.
|===


==== Move all ingredients currently in the cart to inventory
This command allows you to move all the ingredients from the cart into your inventory. This command also
empties your cart. This is helpful after the user has finished shopping and wish to conveniently move all
the ingredients to the inventory.

- Format: `cart move`
- Example:
|===
| Command | Result

|`cart move`
|Moves all ingredients from the cart into the inventory. Also clears the cart of all items.
|===

==== Export ingredients in cart to PDF file
This command allows you to export all the ingredients in the cart to a PDF file. The PDF file will be located in the
same folder as Cooking Papa.

Note: if a previous version of the PDF file, `cart.pdf` is open in another program (Internet browser, Adobe PDF),
Cooking Papa will not be able to export the cart.

- Format: `cart export`
|===
| Command | Result
| `cart export`
a|image::CookbookExportExample1.png[width="790"]
_The exported PDF file will be in the same folder where Cooking Papa is located._

=== Adding ingredients to inventory and cart
The inventory and cart acts as storage for `Ingredient` classes. They are facilitated by `InventoryCommand` and `CartCommand`
respectively, which extends the `Command` abstract class. Since `CartAddCommand` and `InventoryAddCommand` both serve the
same purpose in different contexts of `Cart` and `Inventory` respectively, they will be mentioned together in tandem. +

This command was implemented to allow the user know to add an ingredient to the cart or inventory respectively.
An ingredient only has two main components - its name and quantity. We allow the user to use their own measurement up to their own
preferences and do not force any fixed unit of measurement. Although similar, `Cart` and `Ingredients` differ in certain functions
from a user's point of view. For a user to immediately sort where they wish to sort the ingredient they are adding, `Cart` and


==== Implementation

Below is a step-by-step sequence of what happens when the command `cart add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` is added.

. The user adds a ingredient to the cart by entering the command `cart  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` in the command line input.
. `CartAddCommandParser` parsers the input to check and verify that the input provided for `i/INGREDIENT_NAME` amd `q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`
are correct. Otherwise a `ParseException` will be thrown.
. The fields are then passed to `CartAddIngredientCommand` as an `Ingredient` object and is returned to `LogicManager`.
. `LogicManager` calls `CartAddIngredientCommand#execute()` and checks if the `Ingredient` object given has the same `INGREDIENT_NAME` and
`INGREDIENT_QUANTITY` unit. If that `Ingredient` exists, it will simply add on to the quantity of that ingredient. Otherwise,
a new instance of that `Ingredient` will be added to the Cart.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#addCartIngredient` will be executed, with the given `Ingredient` as the parameter
. `Model#addCartIngredient` then executes, adding the `Ingredient` to the local cart storage and updates with
`Model#updateFilteredCartIngredientList()`.
. A `CommandResult` with the successful text message is returned to `LogicManager` and will be displayed to the user via the GUI to feedback to the
user that the `Ingredient` has been successfully added.

The above implementation is the same for `Inventory` with the command `inventory  add ingredient i/INGREDIENT_NAME q/INGREDIENT_QUANTITY`

The following sequence diagram shows how the function of adding ingredients to cart work (full command omitted for brevity):

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: The need for many parsers for this command

.Design considerations for the need for many parsers for this command
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Create parsers for every individual action | Design B: Create parsers for each specific action

|Description
|The command will go through the parsers in the following order: `CookingPapaParser` -> `CartCommandParser` -> `CartAddCommandParser`
-> `CartAddIngredientParser` before finally returning `CartAddIngredientCommand`. We eventually went with this as we wanted the add
functionality to be expanded, namely to be able to add all the ingredients of cookbook recipes into the cart.
| `CartAddCommand` will not be created to facilitate `CartAddIngredientCommand` and `CartAddRecipeIngredientCommand`.


|Pros
|More organised and can do more with `cart add` as the prefix.
|The classes can be more specific and atomic in their actions.

|Cons
|Many parser classes to make and keep track of.
|Might lead to disorganisation during troubleshooting with so many classes to keep track.
|===

=== Moving ingredients from cart to inventory
The user may use this command after their shopping trip. With this one command, all ingredients will be shifted from the cart to the inventory.

This command is implemented to ease the process of having the user adding every single ingredient to their inventory after they have bought ingredients from their cart
and eventually deleting the cart after that tedious process. These gives a convenience to users that frequently use our application and we forsee
that such an action will be used very often by these users. As this command only performs an atomic action, no extra
arguments are needed to further supplement the use of this command.

==== Implementation
This command is facilitated by `CartMoveCommand`, which extends the `Command` class. The format of the command is as follows:
`cart move`.

Below is a step by step sequence of what happens when the user executes this command.

. The user enters the command `cart move` in to the command line input.
. `CartMoveCommandParser` then ensures that the user does not enter any other commands after `cart clear`.
. `CartMoveCommandParser` then returns a `CartMoveCommand` and returns it to `LogicManager`
. `LogicManager` calls `CartMoveCommand#execute()`. If there are other commands after `cart clear`, a `CommandException`
will be thrown.
. If `CommandException` is not thrown, `Model#cartMoveIngredients()` will be executed.
. `Model#cartMoveIngredients()` will move every ingredient from the `cart` and add it into the `inventory`
. A `CommandResult` with the success message text will be returned to `LogicManager`, which will then be passed to `MainWindow`
and will then feedback to the user.


The following sequence diagram shows how this function works (full command omitted for brevity):

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Allowing users to move some or all ingredients from cart to inventory

.Design considerations for allowing users to move some or all ingredients from cart to inventory
[cols="12%,44%,44%"]
|===
| |Design A (Current choice): Move all ingredients | Design B: Allow users to move individually or exclude some ingredients when moving

|Description
|There was a consideration to allow the user to move the ingredients by individual ingredients. Eventually the options was
not given as we know that typical users will want to move all the ingredients except for individual ingredients.
| The use cases of such an action happening is very little and the user can simply manually remove the few
ingredients they do not wish to add to the inventory after using the `cart move` command. The user can also manually
add back the ingredients to the cart after it is cleared if they wish to.

|Pros
|Straightforward to implement
|Lesser implementations, more time to focus on other parts of the project

|Cons
|Lesser functionality to users that really want to only move certain ingredients
|Poorer user experience for users that do not want to move all ingredients from the cart to inventory on a regular basis,
