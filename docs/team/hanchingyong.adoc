== PROJECT: TAble

== Overview

TAble is your handy desktop app, optimized for TAs who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)! I have added the functionality for TAs to arrange consults and view all upcoming events in a calendar! The GUI of TAble was created with JavaFX and written in Java, and I have written about 4 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Enabled support for *Consults*
** *What it does*: The user is able to add/edit/delete/list all `Consults` which he has scheduled with a current `Student`.
** *Highlights*: A separate consult panel that displays all of the user's `Consults` exist for the user to easily keep track of all his consults.
Any consults that are overdue are also highlighted in red, to remind the user to delete these outdated consults.

* *Major enhancement*: Added a calendar view for TAble.
** *What it does*:  Added a calendar view that displays all the `Consults`, `Tutorials` and `Reminders` for the user.
** *Highlights*: This calendar is able to show the number of  `Consults`, `Tutorials` and `Reminders` that occurs on a given day in one view, without any information being ommitted.
