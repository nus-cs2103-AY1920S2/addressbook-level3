== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to undo/redo commands
** What it does: allows the user to undo a command, and redo the command after undoing it
** Justification: With an inventory of fast-moving consumer goods, there will be large amount of traffic of goods and
consequently, large number of commands that need to be inputted. This increases the probability of error in the user,
which, if irreversible, may discourage them from using the application.
** Highlights: This enhancement allows easy compatibility with future commands as the implementation is independent of
the details of the execution of command. Memory is used instead of storage to hold the previous states to avoid unwanted
cluttering by temporary files. Significant refactoring was done to avoid much of the code duplication due to the presence of
multiple databases. Interfaces are also extracted for possible future alternative implementations of versioning.
** Credits: To https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4[AddressBook Level 4] by SE Initiative for describing the
general implementation idea of undo and redo

* *Minor enhancement*: added a basic class to represent goods-price pairs
