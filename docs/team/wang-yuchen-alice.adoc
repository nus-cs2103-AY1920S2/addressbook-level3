== PROJECT: FitHelper

---

== Overview

FitHelper is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: added the ability to *undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing models.
** Credits: The proposed "undo/redo" features in AddressBook3 Developer Guide has guided the design of this feature in this project.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added the feature of *Today Page*
** What it does: allows the user to view food/sports entries on today, visualize the distribution of calories in their diet, and obtain feedback for their performance.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user usually need to overview the today schedule and adjust the daily arrangement.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Major enhancement 3*: *GUI* main structure [https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-4/main/pull/145[#145]][https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-4/main/pull/147[#147]]
** Justification: This enhancement builds the FitHelper GUI from scratch, creates the main structure of pages, enables page switches and logic-model-GUI connection.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user usually need to overview the today schedule and adjust the daily arrangement.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
