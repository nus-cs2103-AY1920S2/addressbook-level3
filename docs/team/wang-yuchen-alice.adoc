It enables users to record their basic profile data, weight records, daily food intake and sports.
Rather than just keeping the raw data, *FitHelper* also provided useful analysis and other customized services, such as calendar view and reminders.

The application is mainly written in *Java* and built by a considerable *19k Lines of Code*.
The codebase is well-maintained by reasonable amount of tests.
A detailed and comprehensive set of guides are also provided for both application developers and users.
