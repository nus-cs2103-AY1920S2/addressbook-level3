== PROJECT: iTrack Pro

---

== Overview

iTrack Pro is for the grocery shop owners to keep track of the products, customers, and transactions of the shop and have a better understanding of the business by viewing the performance of products and behaviors of customers. It is also able to provide an analysis of the entire business to help the owner manage the shop.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
1. Added *the ability to find customers by specified attributes*
** What it does: allows the user to locate customers easily by name, address, email or phone number.
** Justification: This feature improves the application significantly because user can have many customers, and it can be difficult to keep track of customers manually.
** Highlights: The original find feature was only by name, the implementation has to be changed and refactored to accommodate finding by other attributes too.

2. Added *visualisation of product balance on Product Ui via progress bar indicator*
** What it does: allows the user to easily identify stocks that are running low.
** Justification: This feature improves the application significantly as users would not have to struggle looking at numbers only to see which stock is running low soon.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The difficult part was to determine how the remaining stock was to be calculated, and the best way to structure the classes.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added a command history feature that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/92[#92])
** Added lowlimit command that allows the user to set individual product low quantity threshold (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/98[#98])
** Added notification popup window when stock quantity goes below threshold (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/99[#99])
** Added cost price field to Product class to calculate profit (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/114[#114])
** Updated ui for statistics window (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/129[#129])
** Fixed bugs from PE-D (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/185[#185], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/198[#198])
