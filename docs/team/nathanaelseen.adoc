== Overview

iGrad is a desktop module management and graduation tracking application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX, FXML and CSS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/commits?author=nathanaelseen[All commits]] [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=nathanaelseen[Project Code Dashboard]]

* *Major enhancement*: Added *course management* feature.
** _What it does_: Allows the user to create/edit/delete a course, through which various modules,
and requirements (degree requirements) are 'housed'. Also allows users to track overall
degree progress information, such as overal MCs completed for the course, and current CAP.
** _Justification_: Without a course, it does not make sense to
have modules and degree requirements (by which those modules are mapped under), as standalone
features. In fact, this feature could be said to be the most important feature.
** _Credits_: The original AB3 codebase which provided the necessary 'backing'

* *Major enhancement*: Integrate *course management*, *requirement management*, and *module management*
feature together, by implementing the `module done`,  `requirement assign`, and `requirement unassign`,
commands.
** _What it does_:

*** `module done`: allows the user to record down the grade she has obtained for a particular
module she has completed

*** `requirement assign`: allows the user to assign certain modules under a requirement

*** `requirement unassign`: opposite of requirement assign

** _Justification_: Again this feature is particularly important, in helping one track her graduation
requirements and overall degree progress.

** _Highlights_: This three commands function helps to 'glue' the three components of the app altogether.

*** For instance, in the `module done` command, when a module is marked as 'done', the
_module manager_ is involved to update that module.
Also, _requirement manager_ helps to update all requirements which contains
this module.
Finally, the _course manager_ helps to update information such as the total overal MCs fulfilled,
and CAP.
** _Credits_: Here, I would like to credit the rest of my teamates for implementing the module
management and requirement management feature, without which this feature would not have
been able to make sense.

* *Minor enhancement*: remodularise some UI logic (avatar, Progress Side Panel, etc),
https://github.com/waynewee[Wayne], has initially written.

* *Contribution to Team Based Tasks*:
** In-charge of merging any PRs request, this involves critically reviewing the code,
and fixing it if necessary.

*** Things I checked/helped my teamates fix when merging PRs were;
violating checkstyle, obvious logic bug errors, design/implementation considerations and concerns,
remodularising of code.

*** Also, helped resolve merge conflicts;
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/pull/320[#320],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/pull/307[#307], and
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/pull/295[#295].

** Set-up Reposense, and Nelify for my team, for tracking code contributions and easy reviewing of
UG/DG docs.

** Managed the issue tracker for the first-half of this project.

** Designed the initial application UI prototype for the first draft UG submission.

* *Review/Mentoring Contributions*:
** Assisted https://github.com/teriaiw[Teri], in her initial difficulties understanding and
adapting to such a large code-base, by creating stubs for her implementation. She feedbacked that
she liked my way of mentoring and found it to be really helpful.

** Provided PR code reviews to my team members on code aspects I felt could be be improved, as I
was merging their PRs
