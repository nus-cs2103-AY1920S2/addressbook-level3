== PROJECT: EYLAH

---

== Overview

EYLAH is a desktop application programmed specifically for students staying in Temasek Hall at the National University
of Singapore. It aims to ease their lives in hall by providing them with an application that split bills easily and help
them keep track of their diet. The user interacts with the application using a CLI and it is programmed using `Java 11`.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancements*

. *Added Entry and Receipt for Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH*
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/130[#130])

*** *What it does:* +
Receipt is used to store multiple Entries, and these Entries are used to store the information about a particular Item
and the Persons involved in splitting the cost of that Item.

*** *Justification:* +
These classes are required to keep track of Items and the Persons involved for each of that Item.




. *Added AddItemCommand and enhanced the DeleteItemCommand for the Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH*
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/134[#134],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/164[#163])

*** *What it does:* +
It simply adds a new Entry into the Receipt or deletes an existing Entry from the Receipt.

*** *Justification:* +
The AddItemCommand is required for users to input new Items and the Persons involved in splitting the cost of that Item.
The DeleteItemCommand is for users to remove an Item in case he/she made a mistake or simply wants to remove the Item.

*** *Highlights:* +
These commands are only allowed to be used when the Receipt has not been marked as completed as this was accomplished
using a boolean flag in the Receipt class. This is because of a bug that we discovered, which will be explained in the
point below.





. *Added a boolean flag in Receipt*
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/201[#201])

*** *What it does* +
It checks if the Receipt is marked as complete (true) or incomplete (false).

*** *Justification* +
DeleteItemCommand actually removes the Amount owed by the person from the PersonAmountBook. So does the PaidCommand.
As such, if a user uses the DeleteItemCommand after using the PaidCommand, and if the Amount owed goes to negative,
an exception would be thrown due to the nature of BigDecimal (BigDecimal does not accept negative values).
Hence, a flag was included to prevent this from happening.





. *Added DoneReceiptCommand and ClearReceiptCommand for the Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH*
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/201[#201],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/204[#204])

*** *What it does:* +
DoneReceiptCommand marks the Receipt as done and ClearReceiptCommand removes all existing Entries from the Receipt.

*** *Justification:* +
DoneReceiptCommand is required to toggle the boolean flag of Receipt to be done. ClearReceiptCommand does the opposite
by toggling the Receipt back as undone.

*** *Highlights:* +
These commands are required to prevent an Exception being thrown with regards to negative BigDecimal values, as
explained in the point above.



. *Added CalculateUtil for EYLAH*
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/191[#191])

*** *What it does:* +
CalculateUtil does all the handling of calculations required in EYLAH.

*** *Justification:* +
Abstraction, to make things easier and more streamlined in our application.




* *Minor Enhancements*

. *Removed case sensitivity when adding a new Person*

** *What it does:* +
All the names inputted by the user are now made into lowercase.

** *Justification* +
This is to facilitate quicker use of the application as users would not be required to capitalize any names.
Internally, this is also to prevent duplicate Person objects with the same name (but in different case sensitivity)
from being created, i.e Bob vs bob or aLiCe vs alice.



. *Fixed the rounding issue with regards to using BigDecimal as currency in our application*

** *What it does:* +
Decimals with regards to currency in EYLAH is made to be 2 decimal points (d.p).

** *Justification* +
The Amount class only accepts decimals up till 2 d.p. Users are also made to only input decimals up
till 2 d.p. However, the problem comes when dividing BigDecimals, e.g 10 / 3 = 3.333333... Since we create a new Amount
object called amountPerPerson, i.e new Amount("3.33333"), this would throw an Exception. As such, I made it such that
any all calculations with regards to BigDecimal and Amount would be kept at a maximum of 2 d.p to prevent this Exception
from being thrown. In addition, I also did the formatting of the BigDecimal to be represented as a currency.
