== PROJECT: Internship Diary

---

== Overview

Internship Diary is a desktop internship tracking application written in Java, and has about
15 kLoC. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Revamp the find command
** **What it does:** This enhancement enables the general find where the keywords that the user entered will list
any internship application that has fields that matches any of the keywords provided. This enhancement also enables
finding by specific field(s), where the user can specify which field(s) they are interested in searching in.
Only the internship applications that has the field(s) matching the specified field(s) keywords will be listed in this case.

** **Justification:** This feature will allow the user to easily filter the list to quickly get to what is important.
With the flexibility of general and specific find, the user can get a more specific filtered list if needed.

** **Highlights:** Quite a bit of planning was involved, mainly to consider how the search should behave and how it is performed.
It the end, the plan to use predicates was decided as it will be easy to extend the application with minimal changes in the command.
Quite a bit of knowledge on how predicates work is also required as there was a need to find out how to combine
many predicates cleanly so that it is readable and to ensure that it is working correctly.
There was also a need decide on how I should allow the user to tell the system which of the two types of find command to invoke.
It was decided in the end to use the same command word and have the type of user input be the way of telling the system
which type of find to invoke.

* *Minor enhancement*: Add visual display of upcoming application deadlines and interviews and inactive applications
** **What it does:** This enhancement allows the user to determine which application has deadlines or interviews due in 7 days or if
there are ghosted application by the color of the internship application in the list.
Internship applications with upcoming deadline or interview will show green while ghosted applications will show red.

** **Justification:** This enhancement will allow the user to know what is upcoming and what is ghosted/inactive at a quick glance.

** **Highlights:** Figuring out where the code to update the color should go was a challenge.
Setting it directly in CSS was not possible as I still wanted to keep the odd and even colors for the list.
When setting it in code, I had to figure out why the style will not revert to the default CSS style, leading to visual bugs.
The bugs were fixed after some research.
