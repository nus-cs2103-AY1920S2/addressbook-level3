== PROJECT: ExpenseLa

---

== Overview

ExpenseLa is a desktop expense tracker application used for users to track expense and view insights.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1* : added Monthly Data Tracking
** What it does: allows user to keep track of monthly expense, income and budget.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to keep track of how much money they have spend for the month
and how much money they have earned
** Highlights: This enhancement is vital to the functionality of the expense tracker as one of the major reasons users use
an expense tracker is to keep track of this monthly information
* *Major enhancement 2* : Budget Tracking and Insights
** What it does: allows user to keep track of how much budget they have left with a
graphical interface that shows ratio of expense and budget for the month.
** Justification: This feature makes it easy for user to visualize how much money they have left that they can spend
for the month
** Highlights: The enhancement is a huge quality of life update for users as it has a graphical interface
that makes it easy for user to visualize how much budget they have left. It is also color coded as to serve as a warning
if the user only has very little money left that they can spend
+

+
* *Major enhancement 3* : Recurring Budget
** What it does: allows user to set a budget for every subsequent months.
** Justification: Usually budgets for every month are constant so it makes sense to be able to
set budget for every subsequent months
** Highlights: This enhancement made it easier for users to use the app as they only need to
set their budget once provided that it remains the same


* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

== Product Overview

ExpenseLA is for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money. ExpenseLA maintains a record of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions to constantly keep track of your finances! ExpenseLA is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you want a simple, no-frills expense tracker, look no further than ExpenseLA!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `expensela.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  The UI has 5 different components: Command Input box, Command Result box, Monthly Data panel
Filter panel and Transaction List panel(Chart Analytics Panel)
+
image::UI_annotated.png[width="790"]
+
.  Filters are only to filter transaction list, MonthlyData is data for the current month and not the month
shown in the filter
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  You can navigate through your command history by pressing the kbd:[Up] or kbd:[Down] arrow key.
Only successful commands are stored in the command history. There can be at most 50 commands stored.
This feature is just like the command navigation feature in your favourite command line or shell.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`clear`* : clear the expenseLa app to start at a clean slate
* *`budget b/1000 rc/`* : set a recurring budget of $1000 for the current month and subsequent months
* *`add i/ c/Income n/salary a/2500 d/2020-04-02 rc/` : adds a recurring income with amount `$2500.00`
* **`add a/100`**`n/Wagyu Steak c/FOOD` : adds an expense named `Wagyu Steak` with amount `$100.00` spent on the day it is added in category `FOOD` to the expense tracker
* **`add a/10`**`n/Laksa c/FOOD` : adds an expense named `Laksa` with amount `$10.00` spent on the day it is added in category `FOOD` to the expense tracker
* **`add a/5.5`**`n/Chicken Rice c/FOOD` : adds an expense named `Chicken Rice` with amount `$5.50` spent on the day it is added in category `FOOD` to the expense tracker
* **`add a/50`**`n/shirt c/SHOPPING d/2020-04-08` : adds an expense named `shirt` with amount `50.00` spent on `2020-04-08` in category `SHOPPING` to the expense tracker
* **`filter`**`m/ 2020-04` : filters to only show transactions made on `2020-02`
* **`delete`**`1` : deletes the expense with id `1` in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Set a monthly budget : `budget`

Sets a spendable budget for the current month

Format: `budget b/AMOUNT` (to set a budget for the given month only)
`budget b/AMOUNT rc/` (to set repeating budget of $AMOUNT for the coming months)

Examples:

* `budget b/1000 rc/`
* `budget b/1500`


=== Reset total balance `resetbalance`

Reset Balance value to the total from the amount of all transactions in stored in the application so far.
This command is used in case user messes up with json file or there is an unhandled bug in the app that
causes difference in the value of total balance and the net balance of all the transactions added together.
This command will rectify that issue.


=== Analysis of transactions : `toggleview`

Toggle between viewing list of transactions and analytics with bar graph and pie chart to show expense trend

Expected Outcome: changed view to charts if previously was list view and to list view if previously was chart view

image::ListView.png[width="790"]
image::ChartView.png[width="790"]


=== Export transaction data to csv : `export`

Export the filtered transaction list to a csv file

Expected Outcome: A csv file will be created at the root directory and all transactions currently visible in the app
will be exported to the csv file.

image::Csv.png[width="790"]


=== Import transaction data from csv : `import`

Import transactions from csv and add it to transaction list, duplicate transactions are ignored.

Expected Outcome: All transactions in the csv that is in the correct format and does not exist in the current transaction lsit
will be added to transaction list


=== Clear all data : `clear`

Clear all data in expenseLa including monthly data and global data

Expected Outcome: All transactions are deleted, balance is set to 0 and monthly data is also set to 0.
All recurring data such as budget and transactions are also cleared

[[Design-Logic]]

=== Logic component (Hubert Halim)

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

Logic is an interface which `LogicManager` implements, allowing access to the API. The following items are examples on how the LogicManager class can be interacted with:

.  `Logic` uses the `ExpenseLaParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a `Transaction`).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

=== Setting budgets (Hubert Halim)
We allow the user to maintain a `**Budget**` for the current month and subsequent months. This section details how `**ExpenseLa**` handles
requests made by the user who is trying to set a budget both for a one time and recurring budget. `**Budget**` is contained inside
`**MonthlyData**` object along with `**Expense**` and `**Income**` and application only has 1 `**MonthlyData**` object for the current month.
object looks like:

image::set-budget/BudgetClassDiagram.png[]

If user decides to create a recurring budget, there'll be additional step of updating the `**recurringBudget**` variable in
`**GlobalData**`. `**BudgetCommand**` in addition to modifying `**Budget**` in `**MonthlyData**`, it will also modify `**recurringBudget**`
in `**GlobalData**`.

image::set-budget/GlobalDataClassDiagram.png[]


==== Implementation
Whenever the user attempts to set a new `**Budget**`, `**ExpenseLa**` will create a new MonthlyData object with the given amount.
The application will then call `ModelManager#setMonthlyData(MonthlyData toSet)`. During the creation of the new MonthlyData, the
Budget class will internally check if the budget amount is valid.

We will demonstrate what happens at the back-end whenever the user sets a budget:

Case 1. The user wishes to set their budget to $1500, non-recurring. They execute the command: **budget b/1500**.
The user's entry is checked by `BudgetCommandParser#parse()` and an attempt to parse each parameter occurs:

* `**Budget**` is parsed by `ParseUtil#parseBudget(ArgumentMultimap)`
* `rc/` prefix does not exist, so it is not recurring

NOTE: `**ArgumentMultimap**` is a class that stores all the parsed parameters taken from the user input.

Since the user input is valid, the `**Budget**` is successfully created and inserted into a newly created `**MonthlyData**`.

Case 2. The user made a typo when setting their budget. They execute the command **budget b/1500**.
The user's entry is checked by `BudgetCommandParser#parse()` and an attempt to parse each parameter occurs:

* `**Budget**` is parsed by `ParseUtil#parseBudget(ArgumentMultimap)`

`**Budget**` class then is attempted to be created with the parsed budget amount in the constructor. Internally
Budget will do a validity check using Regex and throw a `**ParseExection**` since amount is not valid.

Case 3. The user wishes to set their budget to $1500, recurring. They execute the command: **budget b/1500 rc/**.
The user's entry is checked by `BudgetCommandParser#Parse()` and an attempt to parse each parameter occurs:

* `**Budget**` is parsed by `ParseUtil#parseBudget(ArgumentMultimap)`
* `rc/` prefix exists, so it is recurring

Since the user input is valid, the `**Budget**` is successfully created and inserted into a newly created `**MonthlyData**`.
BudgetCommand will then modify `**GlobalData**` in `**Model**` by calling `**Logic#setGlobalData**`. `**RecurringBudget**`
value in `**GlobalData**` is now set to the new `**Budget**`

The sequence diagram below depicts what was just elaborated:

.Sequence diagram showing how a `**Budget**` is set
image::set-budget/SetBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]

.Activity diagram showing how a `**Budget**` is set
image::set-budget/SetBudgetActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design considerations
We have considered various ways as to how `**Budget**` should be stored in `**ExpenseLa**`. In this section, we will explain the
rationale on our course of actions.

===== Aspect: Make `**Budget**` a part of a bigger class called `**MonthlyData**`
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `**Budget**` is a part of `**MonthlyData**` and any `**Budget**` operations is through `**MonthlyData**`
** Pros: Easier to handle `**Budget**` together with other `**MonthlyData**` objects and all data inside is synchronised as it is
handled by a single object.
** Cons: Overhead when modifying `**Budget**` as to maintain immutability, a new `**MonthlyData**` object has to be created.
* Alternative 2: `**Budget**` should be an independent class with a direct reference in `**ExpenseLa**`.
** Pros: More freedom and efficiency in doing modifications on `**Budget**`
** Cons: Need to maintain more references for all different objects.

Again, we went with alternative 1 because it is easier to view `**Budget**` along with the other `**MonthlyData**` components
as a collective. And easier to just handle 1 reference in ExpenseLa.
// end::setbudget[]


// tag::commandHistoryNavigation[]
=== Command History navigation (Hubert Halim)
Users can navigate to previous commands by pressing the up or down button on the keyboard.
Only successful commands are stored in the CommandHistory list and only a maximum of 50 commands can
be stored at a time.

==== Implementation
Every time the user key in a command and press kbd:[Enter], `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered` method will be called.
The method will attempt to execute the command by calling `CommandExecutor#execute` method. That method throws an error
if command is invalid. So if the command is valid, the `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered` method will call
`Logic#deleteCommandFromHistory` to delete the command if it exists in the current command history.
It will then call `Logic#addToCommandhistory` to add the command to the command history as its latest entry.
Both commands for add and delete takes in an integer variable called `offset`. This variable is maintained by `CommandBox`
and determines which command the user is currently at in the command history.
Offset starts from -1 indicating `CommandBox` is empty and resets to -1 every time a successful command is entered

`Command History` is an array list that resides in `ModelManager` object. It can be accessed through `Logic` by calling

The diagrams below depicts what was just elaborated:

.Sequence diagram showing what happens when presses Up/Down button

.Activity diagram showing what happens when presses Up/Down button
image::command-history/CommandHistoryNavigateActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Design considerations
We have considered various ways as to how to implement `**CommandHistory**` to support navigation to previous commands
Since we need to capture keyboard events when user press the keyboard, we decided to implement the event listener and handler
in `**CommandBox**` component as it is more convenient because when a keyboard event is captured, the app can straight away
modify the `**TextField**` in `**CommandBox**`. Since the event when user enter a command is also handled in `**CommandBox**`
and we only store successful commands in `**CommandHistory**`, we wait for execution of the Command by `**CommandExecutor**`,
if it is successful, the String for the command is added to, otherwise due to the error thrown and caught somewhere else, the
command is not stored.
