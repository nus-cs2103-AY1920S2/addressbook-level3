== PROJECT: Calgo

== Overview

This portfolio page highlights some of my contributions to Calgo - a Software Engineering project developed in my second year of undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore.

== About the Team

We are 5 Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates reading CS2103T: Software Engineering.

== About the Project

Calgo is a personalised calorie and meal tracker application, morphed from the existing https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book Level 3 (AB3) project] code base. My team was tasked with morphing it via Brownfield software development into a new application, while still maintaining its original Command Line Interface (CLI) nature and the majority of the code architecture.

It is difficult to maintain a balanced diet if you greatly enjoy food. Thus, we created Calgo to solve that issue. Calgo aims to aid seekers of a healthy lifestyle in adhering to a consistent daily dietary goal by increasing the convenience of tracking their daily meals. Calgo can keep track of nutritional information of the food users eat, monitor their daily caloric consumption to ensure they are meeting their goals, and summarises all these into portable insights for even more convenience.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: I improved *the ability to for users to obtain guidance on the usage and format of Calgo commands.*
** What it does: The user can easily refer to a popup `Help Window` should they need a reminder for how the commands work.
** Justification: The initial `help` command requires not only required users to refer to the entire User Guide (UG), it also merely provided a link to the UG. Together, we found both issues very overwhelming and inconvenient. Thus, the `help` function provides a summarised guide for the commands - removing the tediousness of trawling through the UG.
** Highlights: The user can filter the command guide in `Help Window` to show only the commands they want.

* *Major enhancement*: I added *the ability to view a summarised graph of daily caloric consumption for the past seven days.*
** What it does: Calgo displays a line graph of daily caloric consumption against the date.
** Justification: One of Calgo's goals is to provide summarised insights for users. The graph enables a visual version of that.
** Highlights: The graph changes its date axis depending on the date of the currently-displayed `Consumption Record`. Users can thus view insights for different sets of seven days.

* *Minor enhancement*: I modified *the GUI of AB3 to its current state.* (The modification was a team effort, thus this is a minor enhancement due to individual effort amount.)
** What it does: This allows Calgo to display all the information we require it to, such as the `Goal Display` and `Consumption Record`. The colors have also been changed to the current theme.
** Justification: The default AB3 GUI does not support displaying all the information Calgo needs. Additionally, the current blue and orange color theme is used to give Calgo a unique aesthetic, different from AB3.
** Highlights: Calgo has a sleek and compact design, yet allows users to view all relevant information at a glance.
