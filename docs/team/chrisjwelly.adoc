== PROJECT: ResuMe

---

== 1. Overview

=== 1.1 About the Project
ResuMe is a desktop resume management application developed by a team of students from National University of Singapore (NUS). The application is aimed at university students, who may want to manage different resumes due to internship and job applications.

The project builds upon the code from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/addressbook-level3[Address Book Level 3 (AB3)], a desktop Address Book application. ResuMe retains the characteristics of AB3, and thus ResuMe has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) while most interactions happen through the Command Line Interface (CLI).

The application is developed using Java, and within a short span of 6 weeks we have contributed a total of more than 25,000 lines of code to the application.

=== 1.2 About the Team
The team consists of 5 Year 2 Computer Science students from NUS, taking the Software Engineering module, CS2103T.

==== 2.1.1 Enhancements Implemented

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to modify items in the resume*: `redit`
** What it does: allows the user to selectively modify the items in a specified resume.
** Justification: This is a key feature in the application because a user would need to select existing items in the resume to be included before generating them.
** Highlights: This enhancement is particularly tricky to implement due to the various possibilities of input that a user can give. For example, a combination of internship and project items. Careful parsing of the input is required before the command is processed.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to add items in the resume based on tags*: `tagpull`
** What it does: allows the user to add items that have been given a particular tag.
** Justification: This increases the convenience of modifying a resume, since items that have the same tags are likely to be included togehter in the resume.

* *Minor enhancement*: modified the `edit` command and its parser to suit the application
** Justification: ResuMe requires handling of various item types such as `Internship`, `Project` and `Skill` items. Therefore, it is necessary to morph the existing `Parser` from AB3 to suit our needs.

* *Minor enhancement*: wrote the `view` command
** Justification: Items such as `Project` omit a lot of details in our list in the GUI. The `view` command helps include more details about the `Item`.

=== 2.2 Contributions to team-based tasks:

==== 2.2.1 Morphed CommandResult in overall architecture
* What it means: `CommandResult` has been separated to many different subclasses which correspond to the different `Command`.
* Justification: Several `CommandResult` require a special boolean value to indicate that it is the result of a certain `Command`. With only one class, the constructor would have to take in many booleans in the constructor and this gets very messy.

==== 2.2.2 Project management
* Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.2` (2 releases) on GitHub
* Managed GitHub issue tracker
* Set-up Travis and Coveralls
