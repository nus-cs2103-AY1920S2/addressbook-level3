== PROJECT: ZeroToOne

image::user-guide/UgWorkoutList.png[]

== Overview

ZeroToOne is a desktop application that serves as an all-in-one exercise tracker and personal aide. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 26 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added Workout feature.

** *What it does*: Allows users to manage their workouts and the corresponding exercises in each of their workouts. Users can perform CRUD operations on workouts, and on exercises belonging to workouts. This whole set of functionality can be viewed from the Workout tab in the app.

** *Justification*: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to group and organise different exercises into a workout. This allows the user to have different workouts for different fitness purposes.

** *Highlights*: This enhancement affects the existing Exercise, Schedule and Log features. Future expansions will likely utilise Workouts because it has significant practical usage in order to work out. Hence, this feature required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

** *Credits & Enhancements*: Some ideas for this feature was taken from the AB3 code. However, it ended up significantly different, as the purpose of the code differed. Hence, an additional layer of code was added to support Workout objects that in turn managed Exercise objects.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the About display.

** *What it does*: It is a separate tab in the app, which displays some basic information about the app, and also a full list of all commands that can be executed.

** *Justification*: Allows users to easily access information about ZeroToOne in-app, without needing to refer to a User Guide.
