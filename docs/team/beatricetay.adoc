== PROJECT: HealthyBaby

---

== Overview

*HealthyBaby* (HYBB) is a desktop application targeted towards university students that provides users with a database of quick, easy, and healthy recipes.
HYBB helps alleviate the challenges faced while maintaining healthy eating habits, easing the transition from eating
out everyday to cooking healthy meals regularly.

The user interacts with HYBB using a Command Line Interface, and it has a Graphical User Interface created with JavaFX.

It is written in Java, and has about 18 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *Planning feature*
** What it does: Allows the user to plan and remove the plans for a recipe on a certain date. The user is also able to
obtain all ingredients required for the planned recipes on a simple grocery list.
** Justification: Assists users in making healthy cooking easier as the user
can plan for recipes containing Goals for the nutritional food group that they want to focus on.
Users can save money and reduce food wastage by planning for recipes with similar ingredients and purchasing only
items that they need using the grocery list command.
** Highlights: This enhancement is affected by recipes being modified, as the plans of the modified recipe needs to be
updated as well. Ensuring that each plan is deleted or updated after each modification was challenging as HYBB supports
many recipe customisation methods (9 in total).

* *Minor enhancement*: Added Ingredient and Quantity classes to allow HYBB to estimate the portion of each food
group in the recipes.
