== PROJECT: TA-Tracker

=== Overview

TA-Tracker is a productivity tool made for *NUS Computing Teaching Assistants (TAs)*
who want to be able to track and manage all of their claimable hours and the students
they are teaching in one place. The application is written in *Java* and spans *20k
Lines of Code*.

=== Summary of contributions

*Student View* refers to the view that allows the user to manage their students.
As the main developer that created *Student View*, my main contributions were in
the *Student View*. They include *creating models, writing commands, creating tests
and adding documentation for the Student View*. In total, I wrote almost *7kLoc*.

==== Create the Models

I created the `Module`, `UniqueModuleList`, `Group` and `UniqueGroupList` models
that were used in *Student View* from scratch.
These models are necessary to ensure the
proper functioning of the commands in the *Student View*.
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/88[#88])

I created a lot of supporting methods for the UI, especially the highlighting feature
which highlights the currently shown module and group.
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/202[#202])

I also added the required support for the filter feature in the models which allows
the user to filter the students they're viewing by module code and group code.
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/191[#191]).

==== Sort Commands

* *What it does:* Allows the user to sort the students by rating (in ascending or
descending order), by matriculation number or alphabetically. There are three variations
of the sort - `sort all` which is used to sort *all students in all groups of all modules*,
`sort module` which is used to sort *all students in all groups of a particular module* and
`sort group` which is used to sort *all students in a particular group of a particular module*.
* *Justification:* This feature improves the product as TA's are often required to
sort their students in different ways. For example, *alphabetically* when taking attendance,
by *matriculation number* when grading assessments or by *rating* when keeping track of
strong or weak students.
* This feature was difficult to implement as it had several sub-parts.
Furthermore, it had initially been implemented in a different way
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/195[#195],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/200[#200])
but later had to be changed in order for it to be compatible with the *interactive parser*
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/205[#205]).

==== Other Commands
The other commands I implemented are:

. `module add` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/102[#102])
. `module delete` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/107[#107])
. `module edit` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/206[#206])
. `group add` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/121[#121])
. `group delete` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/122[#122])
. `group edit` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/196[#196])

* These commands are needed to manipulate data in the *Student View*.
* Overall, these commands required a fair amount of work, especially due
to the possible edge cases they have such as the user changing the group code to that
of a pre-existing group.

==== Testing

I created all the classes required to test the *Student View* such as `GroupBuilder`,
`ModuleBuilder`, `TypicalGroups`, `TypicalModules`, etc. I also wrote the tests
for all my enhancements and have an average coverage over 85% for my sections in the
codebase. (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/232[#232],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/345[#345])

==== Other contributions:

** Managed release `v1.4` on GitHub

** Refactored the codebase to make it match TA-Tracker
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/142[#142])

** Documentation:
*** Created a User Guide skeleton for everyone to follow and made a few cosmetic
tweaks to existing contents (such as adding a table for the common parameters and the glossary)
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/215[#215])
*** Updated the User Guide and Developer Guide with details for the Student View
and the commands used in the Student View.
*** Added screenshots of the UI with annotations to the User Guide for all commands
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/371[#371])
