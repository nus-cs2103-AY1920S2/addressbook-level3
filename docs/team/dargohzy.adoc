== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: added *backend to frontend functionality*
** What it does: allows for visible change on the GUI upon user input.
** Justification: This feature allows the user to view data that they have input into the system, such that they are able to view their data in a cohesive window.
** Highlights: This feature was done mainly by adding and refactoring existing code from AB3.

* *Major Enhancement*: added and designed *a clean and user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI)*
** What it does: improves user experience greatly.
** Justification: Greatly improves usability by ensuring that the user experience is good when using the application.
** Highlights: Did up initial mock-ups on Photoshop as well as revamping the initial from AB3 to provide a template for the current UI. Also did up initial skeletons for various UI components.
** Credits: Skeleton code for multiple GUI components before handing over to https://github.com/waynewee[Wayne] for future iterations.

* *Major Enhancement*: added *module validation* when adding from NUSMods.
** What it does: added modules are validated to check if prerequisites or preclusions already exist in the current data.
** Justification: Important to ensure that modules added do not clash for the user, which may affect module planning.
** Credits: Adding modules based on NUSMods data functionality by https://github.com/waynewee[Wayne], further improvements also by https://github.com/waynewee[Wayne].
