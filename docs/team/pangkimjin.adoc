== PROJECT: ExpenseLa

---

== Overview

ExpenseLa is a desktop expense tracking application for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed
decisions when it comes to saving money. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 16 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to filter transactions based on category or transaction month*
** What it does: Allows the user to apply category or month filters to the transaction list in the transaction list view. +
    On top of this core functionality, `filter` also interacts closely with many other features to:
*** Display specific transactions for a shorter and more relevant transaction list to `edit` or `delete` transactions
*** Include/exclude transactions for the user to view chart analytics using the `toggleview` feature
*** Include/exclude transactions for the `export` feature
*** Include/exclude transactions for the ExpenseLa Statement proposed feature
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because `filter` reduces the size of the transaction list
shown to the user, leaving behind only the relevant transactions. +
And upon application launch, `filter` is preset to show only transactions of the current month to prevent overloading the user with information.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands, support for multiple filter types at once, and support for future
feature extension.


* *Major enhancement*: Implemented *Pie Chart for a breakdown of expenses* in the month by category, according to the filter set by the user.
** What it does: Provides a visual representation of the amount spent per category as a percentage of the total amount spent in the filter's month.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because users are able to tell, at a glance, where the bulk of their money has been spent on.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented responsive UI for `filter` command with colour schemes matching the transaction categories.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=pangkimjin&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[RepoSense]] [https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-3/main/pulls?q=is%3Amerged+is%3Apr+author%3APangKimJin[Pull Requests]]

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

==== Filter transactions : `filter`

Filters transactions for user to view specific transactions according to the filter type. Upon application
launch the preset filter is for all transactions in the current month as depicted below:

image::Filter.png[width="790"]

Format: `filter c/CATEGORY m/YYYY-MM`

Expected Outcome: Filter is changed to the filter specified. List of transactions will only
show transactions that fulfill the filter criteria.

[TIP]
If only 1 filter type is specified (either category or month), the other filter type will automatically be set to "ALL".

Examples:

* `filter m/2020-04` - show transactions in April 2020 across all categories
* `filter c/TRANSPORT` - show transactions with category "TRANSPORT" across all months
* `filter c/FOOD m/2020-04` - show transactions with category "FOOD" in April 2020
* `filter c/ALL m/ALL` - show all transactions


==== Data Encryption [coming in v2.0]

With the AES-256 encryption, ExpenseLa ensures that the sensitive information you have provided is safe from outside
prying eyes, and this is all done without any additional effort from the user.

==== ExpenseLa Statement `Statement` [coming in v2.0]

With the ability to generate your personalised ExpenseLa statement, you will be able to export all your expenses,
income, budget, and balance information into a pdf document. Using ExpenseLa's `Filter` command, you will be able
to selectively include which transactions to make your statement tailored to your needs.

==== Architecture

In this section, we will be introducing the individual components that form ExpenseLa using various diagrams.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the `Logic` Component

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

==== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores an ArrayList which contains the user's command history.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the `ExpenseLa` data.
* stores the `GlobalData` which contains the recurring budget, transactions, total balance, and last updated date.
* stores a `MonthlyData` object which contains budget, expense, and income information set by the user.
* stores a `ToggleView` object that represents the nature of transaction information displayed to the user.
* stores a `Filter` object which represents the filter on the transactions as set by the user
* stores `TransactionList` which contains the list of all transactions
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Transaction>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

==== Filtering Transactions (Pang Kim Jin)

The `Filter` command allows the user to bring up a list of `Transaction`, and filter it by either category, month,
or both at the same time. This is implemented by using a predicate for category and another predicate for month,
both of which inheriting from `Predicate<Transaction>` to filter the `Transaction`.

==== Implementation

`FilterCommand` is instantiated by `FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)` method, which parses the arguments supplied in the user
command to return a `FilterCommand` object.

The below sequence diagram depicts the interactions within the `Logic` component for the execute("filter c/FOOD m/2020-04") call:
image:FilterSequenceDiagram.png[]

The below scenario shows a typical usage of the filter feature:

Step 1: Upon application launch, the filter for all categories and the current month is automatically applied.
image:filter/Filter_SS_1.PNG[]

Step 2: User executes the command `filter c/food m/2020-02` to bring up transactions in the category "FOOD" for the month
of February 2020. (Note: The command in the command line disappears upon hitting Enter, the command in the command line
is purely for illustration purposes).
image:filter/Filter_SS_2.PNG[]

Step 3: The `FilterCommandParser#parse(String args)` parses the arguments.

Step 4: Since user input is correct and the arguments are parsed, a new `FilterCommand` object is created by the
`FilterCommandParser`.

Step 5: The `FilterCommand` object will use a `Predicate<Transaction>` based on the specified category, month, or both, to filter
the list of transactions.

Step 6: The list of filtered transactions is brought up. The filter category and month UI will also update accordingly
to show the category and month that the transactions are filtered by.

The below activity diagram gives an overview of the command execution:
image:filter/FilterActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: Using `Predicate` to improve extendability of the `Filter` feature in the future.*

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a new `Predicate<Transaction>` for each new filter type
** Pros: Greater flexibility can be provided for each filter type since different filter types have different requirements (e.g. Month vs Category)
** Cons: Tedious to implement a new class for each new type of filter
* Alternative 2: Use a single `Predicate<Transaction>` to filter for all filter types
** Pros: Easy to implement
** Cons: Prone to being inflexible for extensions

We decided to go with Alternative 1 since the current filter feature supports increasing the number of filter types
- on top of the current category and month filters. Despite having a different `Predicate` for each filter type, we use
a composed `Predicate` comprising of both `Predicate` s, making it much easier to support extensions to this feature.

==== Proposed Extension

We plan to enhance the filter feature to support other arguments in the command to filter by different types such as
price range or date range. This allows the user to have greater flexibility and have a better understanding of his/her
expenses.

The design consideration mentioned earlier hence facilitates this proposed extension, reducing the difficulty of such a
future implementation.

==== [Proposed] Data Encryption

Given the sensitive nature of the information provided by users, we would like to safeguard the information provided by
our users through encryption. Naturally, the information would be encrypted and decrypted in the back-end without the user
requiring to do any of the encryption, decryption, or even any knowledge of how it works.

==== Proposed Implementation

We thus propose a `Keystore` module to contain authorisation certificates or public key certificates
interacting with the `Logic` and `Storage` modules. With this addition, the following architecture diagram
gives an overview of how it would fit in:

image::DataEncryptionClassDiagram.png[]

The `Keystore` module would have a `KeystoreManager` which implements the following methods:

* `KeystoreManager#setCipher(Cipher cipher)` - sets the `Cipher` for encryption usage.
* `KeystoreManager#encryptExpenseLa(ExpenseLa expenseLa)` - encrypts the given `ExpenseLa` object with the encryption cipher set with every
call to `LogicManager#execute()` method.
* `KeystoreManager#decryptExpenseLa(ExpenseLa expenseLa)` - Decrypts the encrypted json file upon application launch.

The following class diagram provides a depiction of the above:

image::DataEncryptionClassDiagram2.png[]

NOTE: `KeystoreManager#encryptExpenseLa(ExpenseLa expenseLa)` and `KeystoreManager#decryptExpenseLa(ExpenseLa expenseLa)`
will be using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 256) encryption algorithm.

==== Design Considerations
*Aspect: Encryption Algorithm*

* Alternative 1: Data Encryption Standard
** Pros: Simpler to implement encryption and decryption
** Cons: Weaker security, easy to brute force
* Alternative 2 (current choice) : Advanced Encryption Standard
** Pros: 256 bit key is exponentially more secure than DES' 56 bit key
** Cons: Harder to implement


==== [Proposed] ExpenseLa Monthly Statement

Similar to how banks issue a statement of account, we believe that it would be helpful to provide
our users with an overview of their expenses. This statement would include the user's balance,
budget, expense, income, and transactions in a user specified time frame.The user can choose to include/exclude certain
transactions based on their categories or dates.

==== Proposed Implementation

To generate the statement, we propose a `StatementCommand` that extends `Command` and works with `ModelManager` just like
all other commands, as depicted in the following diagram:

image::StatementCommandClassDiagram.png[]

* The user uses the `FilterCommand` to  filter the list of transactions to show only the transactions with the
user's preferred category and transaction month
* Then `StatementCommand#execute()` will retrieve the `FilteredList` of transactions
and generate a Portable Document Format (PDF) file with Java's PDFWrite API.

Below is a truncated example of the PDF ExpenseLa statement:

image::statement/Statement.png[]

==== Design Considerations

*Aspect: Time and Nature of Transactions to Export*

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Users get to choose when to generate their statement and which month and categories of
transactions to include.
** Pros: Users get a statement tailored according to their needs.
** Cons: Users may forget to include certain types of transactions.
* Alternative 2: At the end of every month, a statement of all transactions and user information is exported
** Pros: Users get a comprehensive view of their expenses
** Cons: Users may be overloaded with information

Ultimately we chose Alternative 1 as we prioritise our user's freedom of choice and we understand that not all transactions
may be relevant for the purposes of exporting the statement.
