== PROJECT: ExpenseLa

---

== Overview

ExpenseLa is a desktop expense tracking application. The user works with a Command Line Interface (CLI), and enjoys a
Graphical User Interface(GUI) created using JavaFX. It is written in Java for an NUS module CS2103/CS2103T Software Engineering.

== Summary of contributions

This section provides a summary of the various contributions I have made to ExpenseLa.

=== Enhancements implemented

* *Major enhancement*: Created *bar chart* of the expenditures
** What it does: Allows the user analyse his expenditure using bar chart.
** Justification: Viewing just a list of transactions does not provide much information of his expenditure, especially if there are many transactions. Viewing it as a bar chart will allow him to analyse his expenditures better.
** Highlights: Different kinds of bar chart can be showed depending on the filter set on the transactions. When filter is of a certain month,
a stacked bar chart with days of the week as the x-axis is formed, with different weeks stacked on top of each other in ascending order.
While there is no filter, a bar chart with month as the x-axis is formed, with total expenditures of current year and previous year each shown.
Which has to reference many things from `Model` making it not easy to implement.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to *toggle view* between list of transactions and chart analysis
** What it does: The `toggleview` command allows the user to switch between viewing the list of transactions and chart analysis(as said above) containing the bar chart and a pie chart.
** Justification: The user gets to view more things given the limited space the app has. This prevents compromising the amount of space given to viewing the list of transactions or the chart analysis.
** Highlights: The `toggleview` was implemented as a separate class residing in `ModelManager` for better extendability next time to toggle view between more features.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added an export command that allows the user to export the filtered transactions into a csv file.
** Justification: The user can use the data to do his own analysis of his earnings and expenditure, and in a csv file format it is organized as well as allows the user to easily use excel functions for his analysis.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added percentage to be shown for on pie chart created by my teammate (Pie chart of total expenditure separated by categories).
** Justification: A pie chart for expenditure is to show the relative amount spent on each category relative to the total expenditure. Without percentage shown it can be quite hard to tell the relative amount.
** Highlights: The pie chart library in Java does not support showing percentage, so I had to research how Java's pie chart stores the values, and use that to figure out how to calculate the percentage and concat it into the pie chart, which was not easy to implement.

=== Analysis of transactions : `toggleview` (Choi Min Suk + Pang Kim Jin)

Toggle between viewing list of transactions and analytics with bar graph and pie chart to show expense trend.

If filter is set to a specific month, the bar graph displays the transactions by day of the week. If filter is
set to all months, bar chart will display transactions by month for current and previous year. The pie chart will
show the transactions by the different categories according to the filter.


Expected Outcome: changed view to charts if previously was list view and to list view if previously was chart view.

=== Export transaction data to csv : `export` (Choi Min Suk)

Export the filtered transaction list to a csv file

Expected Outcome: A csv file will be created at the root directory and all transactions currently visible in the app
will be exported to the csv file.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component (Choi Min Suk)

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TransactionListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/expensela/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component does the following actions:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

=== Chart Analytics (toggleview Command and Bar Graphs by Choi Min Suk + Pie Chart by Pang Kim Jin)

The *toggleview* command allows the user to switch between viewing the list of 'Transactions' and viewing an analysis of
his expenditure.

In the expenditure analysis view we have a bar chart to show expenditure breakdown by date as well as a pie chart to
show expenditure breakdown by category.


==== Implementation

`MainWindow` decides whether to show a list of transactions or chart analysis based on `ToggleView#isViewList`, by accessing
`Logic#getToggleView()`.

Here is a Class Diagram for the implementation of `ToggleView`:

image:chart-analytics/ToggleViewClassDiagram.png[]

The *ToggleView* mechanism utilizes `Logic` operations with the `ToggleViewCommand` class in place of `Command`. The following
methods are concrete implementations for the *toggle* operation:

* `ToggleViewCommand#execute()` - Modifies the `ToggleView` in `Model` to view list of transactions or view analytics, and
returns a `CommandResult` (<<Design-Logic, Step 4 of Logic>>).
* `ToggleView#switchIsViewList()` - Modifies the boolean value `isViewList` in `ToggleView` to the negation of it's
current value.
- This `ToggleView` is wrapped in `ExpenseLa` and its `switchIsViewList()` is called through
`ExpenseLa#switchToggleView()`.
- `ExpenseLa#switchToggleView()` is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#switchToggleView()`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates **toggleview** command execution:

.Sequence diagram showing execution of **toggleview**
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Example of usage
Given next is an example and explanation of how the **ToggleView** mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user starts up the application with an initial list loaded from external storage file. The diagram here
depicts the example list used throughout this scenario.

:figure-caption!:
.Example list on startup
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep1.png[,650]

Step 2. The user inputs **toggleview** to change the view from list of transactions to chart analysis.

.User input for toggle view
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep2.png[]

Step 3. `ToggleViewCommand#execute()` switches `isViewList` of `ToggleView` from true to false.

.isViewList of ToggleView switched from ToggleViewCommand#execute()
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep3.PNG[]

Step 4. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` checks the boolean value of isViewList in ToggleView, which is false,
and displays chart analysis.

.Switched from showing list of transactions to chart analysis
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep4.png[,650]

Step 5. User inputs **toggleview** again to change view back to list of transactions.

image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep2.png[]
.Switched from showing list of transactions to chart analysis
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep1.PNG[,650]

Step 6. User can set filter to a certain month to view a different kind of bar chart.

.Example of stacked bar chart of expenditure for a certain month
image::chart-analytics/ToggleViewStep6.PNG[,650]

The following code snippet from `MainWindow#executeCommand()` checking of the boolean value of isViewList in ToggleView,
and deciding whether to show a list of transactions of chart analysis, and what bar graph to show:

.MainWindow#executeCommand()
[source, java]
----
// The if else statement checks the value of isViewList from ToggleView
if (logic.getToggleView().getIsViewList()) {
    // Creates ui for list of transactions
    transactionListPanel = new TransactionListPanel(logic.getFilteredTransactionList());
    transactionListAndChartAnalyticsPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(transactionListPanel.getRoot());
} else {
    // Creates ui for chart analysis
    // Calls logic.getIsFilterMonth() to check if the filter is set to a specific month or not, to decide which bar graph to build
    chartAnalyticsPanel = new ChartAnalyticsPanel(logic.getFilteredTransactionList(), logic.getIsFilterMonth());
    transactionListAndChartAnalyticsPanelPlaceholder.getChildren().add(chartAnalyticsPanel.getRoot());
}
----

===== Execution shown to user
The following activity diagram gives an overview of what ExpenseLa shows the user when executing **toggleview** command:

==== Design considerations
This section shows some of the design considerations taken when implementing the undo and redo features.

===== Aspect: Design used to implement toggelview feature

* Alternative 1 (current choice): Create a ToggleView Class to keep a boolean value of isViewList to keep track of
showing list of transactions or chart analysis.
** Pros: Easily extendable next time to accommodate more different kind of views by changing boolean to possibly enum.
** Pros: Easy to implement functions to change values in `ToggleView` object, which allows easy extendability next time also.
** Cons: Needs to implement many functions through `Logic` and `Model`.
* Alternative 2: Create a boolean value in `Model` to track whether to show list of transactions or chart analysis.
** Pros: Easy implementation and checking of boolean value by `MainWindow` to check which view to show.
** Cons: Not extendable next time when trying to accommodate different kind of views.

Alternative 1 was chosen because it is easily extendable, in case we want to improve or develop on the feature in the
future. It also follows better OOP principles, making the code much neater and understandable.

=== Export (Choi Min Suk)

The *export* command allows user to export currently filtered transactions to a csv file, in case he would like to use
the data for his own analysis.

==== Implementation

`ExportCommand` is instantiated by `ExpenseLaParser#parseCommand(String userInput)`, which attempts to split the userInput
into the command word and its parameters. Since `ExportCommand` does not require any arguments, it is instantiated directly.


`ExportCommand` obtains the filtered list of transaction to export using `Model#getFilteredTransactionList()`, which then
attempts to create a csv file in the current directory using the attributes of each transaction.

The sequence diagram below shows how the execution of *export* is like:

.Sequence diagram of how *export* command is applied at the back-end.
image::export/ExportSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following conditions will cause a `**CommandException**` to be thrown by the command:

. Empty filtered transaction list
. Failure in creating the file
. Failure in writing to the file (Possibly due to the directory changing while the command is being executed)

The image below shows how the csv file looks when user executes *export* command successfully:

.List of transactions in a csv file opened in Microsoft Excel
image::export/ExportCsv.PNG[,650]

==== Proposed extension
In the near future, we plan to enhance the export feature. We want to improve the export command to take in view as a
possible argument, thus allowing the user to choose between exporting list of transactions or the chart analysis. The
user can use the chart analysis generated for visual presentations, especially if the expense tracker is for a business.

The image below shows how a possible future implementation of this feature could look like:

== Effort

In this section, we highlight the amount of effort taken for us to develop ExpenseLa, the challenges faced in this development and our eventual achievement.

=== Effort by team

Our application, ExpenseLa, is considerably different from what Address Book 3 (AB3) had implemented. We wanted to take some address book features
that were available in AB3, but wanted to build an expense tracker for our project. As such, to build ExpenseLa, we took and modified some features previously
available in AB3, but had to create many of our own models and implementations for the new features.

In short, AB3 stores details related to multiple people known to the user. ExpenseLa stores data related to multiple transactions by
the user and so much more. ExpenseLa uses that data to track the monthly expenditure, income as well as budget, analyses their expenditure
by graphing it out, and provide many other features like filtering transactions as well as new ways of adding transactions to make the application
easier to use.

While building ExpenseLa, we spent a considerable amount of time not just implementing our features, but also making sure that new features were linked
to ExpenseLa and could cohesively work with other features to make sure the application provided and smooth and consistent user experience. All these discussions
were held at least once a week with a minimum 2 hours each round to provide feedback for each other's implementations and that our implementations could work together.

=== Challenges faced

The team encountered some challenges while developing ExpenseLa. The most notable ones are:

- *Initial brainstorming of ideas* +
At the start of the project, we wanted to do a meeting scheduler for NUS computing students. However after multiple discussions, we deemed it unfit to implement
as there were too many components to think about and difficult to implement given our limited time to complete the application. Thus we decided to make an expense
tracker instead. We had many different ideas for our expense tracker and ways to implement them. We needed a few meetings to discuss and iron out our direction for
the project to ensure everyone was on the same page before starting the development process.

- *Storage* +
We needed a way to store our data so when the application starts we can load previously stored transactions and other data. We decided to adopt and modify slightly AB3's
storage system and implement it in ExpenseLa.

- *Commands* +
An expense tracker requires many different commands to carry out many different actions, especially since it uses command line interface. We adapted AB3's parser. For
similar commands to AB3 like add, we had to change the command to accept different predicates, thus parsing it differently. We also had to think about how to parse new commands,
such as filter function and parsing recurring budget and transactions to be stored as Global data (talked about below), which was a big change from AB3.

- *Global data* +
We set ExpenseLa to be timeframe specific, with Monthly Data such as budget, income and expenditure for the month to reset at the beginning of every month.
However we also had some data that were not timeframe specific, such as transactions and budget that were set to be recurring every month. We could not store
and reference it the same way as how the normal transactions were referenced from the json data. After discussion, we decided to create a `GlobalData` class in `ModelManager`
where it will be referenced separately from `ExpenseLa`.

- *User interface* +
We decided to keep a ExpenseLa's UI generally similar to AB3, but with addition of new UI features. We created a new placeholder for `Monthly Data` for easy constant viewing by
the user. We created a chart analysis for the expenditures, which was in the form of a bar chart and pie chart. The charts took up a considerable amount of space, and putting a separate
placeholder for it would be unfeasible for small screens. Thus we implemented a `toggleview` command which allows the user to toggle between viewing the list of transactions and the chart analytics.
This required us to learn both the chart libraries as well as think about how we were going to change the views, while updating the charts when new commands were added.

*Conclusion* +
From planning to documentation to coding of the project, the team believes that every member has put in equal and huge amount of effort on all parts of the project. We believe that
our product is significantly different from AB3, with many new features which were carefully planned in implementation, and we are proud of ExpenseLa we have built.
