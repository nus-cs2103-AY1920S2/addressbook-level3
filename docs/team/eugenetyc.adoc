== PROJECT: Calgo

=== Overview

This portfolio page highlights some of my contributions to Calgo - a Software Engineering project developed in my second year of undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore.

==== About the Team

We are 5 Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates reading CS2103T: Software Engineering.

==== About the Project

Calgo is an all-in-one personal meal tracking assistant which seeks to encourage a healthy lifestyle among its users. It allows users to not only have a convenient nutritional record of all their favourite food entries, but also track, monitor, and plan their food consumption. Moreover, the team has come up with a plethora of user-centric features to make Calgo well-suited to provide users with both convenience and utility.

My team was tasked with morphing an existing https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3[Address Book Level 3 (AB3) project] into a new product via Brownfield software development.
We were therefore required to use the existing AB3 project as Calgo's project foundation, to create a desktop application supporting the Command Line Interface. This was to target users who prefer typing but also enjoy the benefits of a Graphical User Interface.
With all of us being food lovers and realising a greater societal need for healthy eating, Calgo was born.

=== Summary of contributions

==== Enhancements

* *Major enhancement*: I implemented categorical search via the `find` command.
** What it does: This allows users to search for `Food` entries by narrowing down on a specific `Food`-related attribute of either `Name`, `Calorie`, `Protein`, `Carbohydrate`, `Fat`, or `Tag`.
** Justification: Users now have an option to perform refined searches, preventing the need to tediously scroll through the `Food Record`.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires in-depth understanding of the application's architecture. A new parser for the `find` command was created to detect different prefixes entered by the user, as with supporting classes to facilitate background workings.

* *Major enhancement*: I implemented the `export` command.
** What it does: This allows users to export their current `Food` entries to a portable, neatly formatted editable .txt file. They can now also add their own notes and share their entries.
** Justification: This improves user experience as they can now obtain a copy of their `Food` entries for multiple purposes like printing onto paper.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires comprehensive understanding of how commands are processed. A new class for the command, as well as supporting classes (such as for table formatting) were created. Moreover, as the `report` command is similar, we applied good OOP practices for better code quality and reuse.

* *Minor enhancement*: I implemented substring search via the `find` command.
** What it does: This allows users to search for `Food` entries by typing incomplete keywords for searching using the `Name` or `Tag` prefixes. Results are entries containing these substrings.
** Justification: Users no longer have to type the full keyword. Those who are lazy, or happen to enter incomplete keywords can still have their results shown.
** Highlights: This enhancement relies on `Predicate` s, as with categorical search above.

* *Minor enhancement*: I implemented the lexicographical ordering of `Food` objects.
** What it does: This makes the `Food Record` show all entries in lexicographical order.
** Justification: It is frustrating to scroll through messy entries.
** Highlights: We perform sorting only when Calgo starts up or when new entries are added for efficiency.
