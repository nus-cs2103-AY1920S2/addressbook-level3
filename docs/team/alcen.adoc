== PROJECT: Coupon Stash

'''

image::Ui.png[width="600"]

== Overview

Coupon Stash is a desktop application for keeping track of your
coupons, coupon usage, and coupon savings. Coupon Stash is written
in Java, JavaFX and FXML, by a team of 5 committed individuals
(including me). Featuring a command-line interface as well as
UI elements like calendars and graphs, Coupon Stash is an amazing
application and a prominent highlight of my abilities.

== Summary of contributions

In this section, I will provide a brief summary of my contributions
to Coupon Stash, as well as to documents like the User Guide
and Developer Guide.

* *Major enhancement*: The *savings* feature allowing users to
keep track of how much they have saved from using coupons

** Tracking savings per usage allows the user see how much they have
saved, over the course of a certain time period.
** This feature improves the product significantly because a key part
of coupons is the savings and benefits it brings to the user, and so
there is demand for knowing how much benefits you have reaped
easily.
** This feature was not easy to add as it required consideration
about the various forms of savings that coupons may offer, such
as a percent off the original price, a flat monetary amount, or
even free gifts. Also, it required integration with other
features, like the "used" feature which allows users
to mark their coupons whenever they use them.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a "setcurrency" command so users
can customise the application to different regions, which
would be helpful for exchange students for example.
