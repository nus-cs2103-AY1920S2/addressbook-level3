== PROJECT: Modulo

== Overview

Modulo is for NUS students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their school work on a modular level. It helps you to break down your modules into deadlines and track their progress.

Currently Modulo is made for NUS students taking modules this Academic Year AY2019/2020 Semester 2! More importantly,
Modulo is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Modulo can get your module management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Implemented *Deletion function to delete modules, events and deadlines*
** What it does: allows the user to delete modules, events or deadlines
** Justification: This feature is important as it is an essential function should the user want to delete Modules, Events or Deadlines from Modulo.
** Highlights: This feature also allows for deletion of multiple Modules and Events at a time. For example while on the Module view,
`delete CS` will delete all modules containing `CS`. This provides an added convenience for the user should the user want to delete
some events / modules containing certain keywords. Modulo will also return the appropriate feedback should the user
enter invalid inputs or use the command inappropriately.

* *Minor enhancement*: Initial logic implementation to *switch between left panel views*.
** What it does: Refreshes the list view every time the user switches between module and event views.
** Justification: This feature was important as our team wanted to ensure that users were able to switch between list views in Modulo.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented *FindCommand*
** What it does: allows the user to find modules or events using certain keywords.
** Justification: This feature is important as it is an essential function should the user want to find modules or events by certain keywords.
** Highlights: This FindCommand allows additional filtering (not only once). For example if the user wants to search for `tutorial 1` from the module
`CS2103`, the user can first enter `find CS2103` and then `find tutorial 1`. Modulo will also return the appropriate feedback should the user
enter invalid inputs or use the command inappropriately.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented *ListCommand*
** What it does: allows the user to list modules or events on the left panel of Modulo.
** Justification: This feature is important as it allows the user to switch between the module and event view.

* *Minor enhancement*: Created *Module and Event Cards* to display the details of events and modules
** What it does: provides details of modules and events.
** Justification: This feature is important as it allows the user to see details of modules and events in the list
** Credit: Modified the Module and Event Cards with help from the original implementation of PersonCard from AddressBook3.
