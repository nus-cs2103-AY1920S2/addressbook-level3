== About the Project

HireLah! is targeted to bring greater convenience to interviewers who can type quickly and prefer typing over mouse +
commands. Additionally, we included customised features in our desktop apps to help interviewers to manage interviews.

=== My Role

My role was to design and write codes to create the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of HireLah!, such that the GUI is +
elegant and convenient to use. I will elaborate on my contributions in the following sections.

Listed in the table below are some notations that are used throughout the document.

As shown in <<Legend>>, these icons associated to their following descriptions, such as commands, tips, important information and useful information, enable greater clarity in understanding the document. Note that useful information will have text enclosed in its box.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement #1*: Designed and implemented the UI components of HireLah!
** What it does: It enables users to view all the information relevant to an interview, including the list of +
interviewees, lists of rubrics (including attributes, questions and metrics), as well as the transcript of each +
interviewee after an interview. This can be done via the `list` as well as `open` commands.

** Justification: This feature allows an user to easily navigate between and find the information that he/she needs in +
order to conduct an interview, without the hassle of cross-referencing various sources of information.
** Highlights: This feature depends on the backend implementation of HireLah! and therefore requires consistent
communication with the rest of my teammates in order to correctly display features implemented by them. This is not +
easy as I have to take into account the constraints of the UI elements and possible use cases, such as inputting long +
paragraphs of text or resizing the application, and ensure that the UI still displays correctly.


* *Code contributed*: The code that I have contributed to HireLah! can be found [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=mario7lorenzo[here]].
