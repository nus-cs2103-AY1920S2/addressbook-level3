== Overview

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous deck-level commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: *AddressBook Level 4*

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* *Other contributions*:
* added an *open command* that allows the user to open decks to access card.
* modified the *add command* and relevant classes (example *add command parser*) to ensure basic functionality of the application.
* modified the *delete command* and relevant classes (example *delete command parser*) to ensure basic functionality of the application.
* modified the *edit command* and relevant classes (example *edit command parser*) to ensure basic functionality of the application.
* added deck and flashcard exceptions to ensure that the application is less buggy for the user. Examples of exceptions added are "Deck not found exception" and "Wrong Deck Exception".
