== PROJECT: EYLAH

---

== Overview

EYLAH is a desktop application specifically programmed for Freshmen staying on NUS Campus. It aims to ease their lives
at halls/residential colleges by providing them with an application to split bills easily and help
them track their diet. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancements*:

. Adding of *Height, Weight, Mode, Bmi and Self classes, and their storage components
for the Diet Tracker* portion of EYLAH
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/109[#109], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/109[#109], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/157[#157], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/312[#312])

*** *What it does:* +
These classes are used to stored user's metrics and also perform calculations.

*** *Justification:* +
The User needs a Health Metrics Tracker to aid his Dieting.

*** *Highlights:* +
Implementing Self was rather tricky at first, since I had used static references class attributes,
thinking that it would be stored without a Storage. Together with Akhil, we managed to resolve this issue.

*** *Credits:* +
My groupmate Akhil, who helped with the correction for some of the bugs in the implementation of the classes.
(Akhil's resolution and refactors - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/318[#318])

. Suggested *for the renaming of same sounding class components across both DietTracker and ExpenseSplitter for EYLAH*
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/135#discussion_r393328371[#Github Discussion])

*** *What it does:* +
_Allows_ the integration of the both Diet Tracker and Expense Splitter seamlessly in the unified EYLAH class.

*** *Highlights:* +
I noticed this in my review of my team mate, Shee Xiong's, initial reorganisation of the code to allow for unification of both components. Upon further research, Java does not support **class name aliasing**.

*** *Credits:* +
I understood more about Java Name Aliasing from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2204157/class-or-method-alias-in-java[here].
Shee Xiong, our Team's Integrations IC, went ahead and implemented it eventually in this following PR:
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/232[#232])

* *Minor Enhancements*:

. Performed defensive coding for `bmi`, `height`, and `weight` commands. +
(Height, Weight & Bmi - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/351[#351], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/378[#378])

*** *What it does:* +
`bmi`, `height` and `weight` commands are commands in Diet Tracker,
which includes numerical digits and multiple parameters. Common exploits that could break the program was with Integer Overflow
values. I combat these errorneous commands by setting limits on their values by checking them through BigDecimal.

*** *Justification:* +
Significantly reduces the chances of breaking Diet Tracker and crashing EYLAH.

. Fixed the Calories bug that occurs when Calories are not in the desired range.
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/354[#354])

*** *What it does:* +
Properly validates the user's Calories input for any of the Diet Tracker Commands which involve Calories.

*** *Highlights* +
The original implementation had failed to consider a VALIDATION_REGEX for the Calories String itself, since Calories was built using a long instead of directly from a String.
Another issue was that you could exceed in the input long for Calories which would crash the program also.
This was circumvented using BigInteger.

Questions to ask: +
1. Should users be able to use BMI without input, or even with just a single (Height/Weight) input? +
2. What is different for Calories than other Classes that are stored as attributes? +
