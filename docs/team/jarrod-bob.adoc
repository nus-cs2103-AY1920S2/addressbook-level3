== PROJECT: EYLAH

---

== Overview

EYELAH is a desktop application specifically programmed for Freshmen staying on NUS Campus. It aims to ease their lives
at halls/residential colleges by providing them with an application to split bills easily and help
them track their diet. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:

. Adding of *Height, Weight, Mode, Bmi and Self classes, and their storage components
for the Diet Tracker* portion of EYLAH
(Height, Weight, Self - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/109[#109])
(Bmi - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/132[#132])
(Mode - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/157[#157])
(Related Storge - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/312[#312])

*** *What it does:* +
Height and Weight are used when the User wants to store their personal health metrics into EYLAH
for the ease of Diet Tracking. Self is the object that represents the User in EYLAH.
Bmi is used to do calculations using the Height and Weight of the User.

*** *Justification:* +
These classes are crucial for Diet Tracker to work because the User
is likely to need a Health Metrics Tracker to aid him along his journey of Dieting.

*** *Highlights:* +
Implementing Self was rather tricky at first, since I had used static reference to the Height, Weight and Mode,
thinking that it would be stored without the need of a Storage. Unfortunately, my team mates realised this mistake of mine
during an internal testing round, and together with my Diet Tracker team mate, Akhil, we managed to resolve this Storage and static
reference issue for Height, Weight and Mode in Self.

*** *Credits:* +
My groupmate Akhil, who helped with the correction for some of the bugs in the implementation of the classes.
(Akhil's resolution and refactors - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/318[#318])

. Heavily involved with *setting up of the Commands and Parsers folders and classes for the Diet Tracker* portion of EYLAH.
(Commands - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/157[#157])
(Parsers - https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/107[#107])

*** *What it does:* +
Sets up the base template on how a Command Execution would function through the Parser and the actual Commands.


*** *Justification:* +
This is the foundation by which the Diet Tracker and its commands would be work.


*** *Highlights:* +
By having a template and some basic implementations from the start, our Diet Tracker Team would be better
prepared to handle the addition of new Commands and their relative executions via the different Model Managers.
*** *Credits:* +
Seedu Addressbook Level 3, for providing a basis by which we could adapt their structure.

. Suggested *for the renaming of same sounding class components across both DietTracker and ExpenseSplitter for EYLAH*
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/135#discussion_r393328371[#Github Discussion])

*** *What it does:* +
Allows the integration of the both Diet Tracker and Expense Splitter seamlessly in the unified EYLAH class.

*** *Justification:* +
Otherwise, the name usages in the code would be lengthy and hard to read also. Class names in the unified EYLAH files would include the entire path name of the Class file.

*** *Highlights:* +
I noticed this in my review of my team mate, Shee Xiong's, initial reorganisation of the code to allow for unification of both components. Upon further research as to why he may have left the class names as they were, I realised that it was because Java does not support **class name aliasing**, so we could not import the same named classes from DietTracker and ExpenseSplitter without first renaming them.

*** *Credits:* +
Understanding more about Java from "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2204157/class-or-method-alias-in-java"
Shee Xiong, the our Team's Integrations IC, went ahead and implemented it eventually in this following PR:
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/232[#232])


* *Minor enhancement*:

. Modified the `paid` command to allow a Person to pay his debt fully +
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/209[#209])

*** *What it does:* +
Expanded the `paid` command to accept empty amount field, which meant that the Person paid his debt fully. +
Previously: `paid 1 3` meant that person at INDEX 1 paid $3. +
Now: `paid 1` meant that person at INDEX 1 paid the full amount he owes.

*** *Justification:* +
This allows the user to conveniently clear a Person debt fully.

. Performed defensive coding for `additem` command and `paid` command +
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/352[#352])

*** *What it does:* +
`additem` and `paid` commands are commands in expense splitter
which includes numerical digits and multiple parameters. As a result, these commands may be exploited
when discovering bugs in EYLAH. Common issues includes passing a huge numerical number which causes Integer Overflow
or passing a negative index which causes ArrayOutOfBounds Exceptions. Thus I handled these rouge commands by
including try-catch statement to catch these exceptions.

*** *Justification:* +
This reduces the chances of EYLAH crashing.



* *Major enhancement*: [In Process]

** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

** *Adding of Height, Weight, Mode, Bmi and Self classes for the Diet Tracker portion of EYLAH*
*** What it does:
*** Justification:
*** Highlights:
*** Credits:

** *Adding of HeightCommand, WeightCommand, BmiCommand, ModeCommand for the Diet Tracker portion of EYLAH*
*** What it does: HeightCommand, WeightCommand and BmiCommand are all health metric commands that are essential for any diet tracking app to help the User. BmiCommand is a simple function to allow the user to gauge their current health status.
*** Justification: Without this, a user would not have any realistic goal to aim for.
*** Highlights: Height and Weight, which are taken in as Floating Point numbers, are interesting in that they can be exploited by putting a very large number like '100000000000000000000000' which would then cause permanent damage to the application as it is stored as 'Infinity'.
In order to fix this, I set a cap on the value which could be input into the height field. I injected some fun facts so the user would feel more affection for the application.
*** Credits: For the bug on Floating Point and Storage, I would like to thank my team mate Shee Xiong, who actually brought the bug issues to light.

** *Adapted most of the beginning classes for the DietModel class from Addressbook 3*
*** What it does: The Model and Parsers are extremely important in order to ensure a functioning pre-product.
*** Justification:
*** Highlights:
*** Credits: AddressBook Level 3 "https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3"

** *Suggested for the renaming of same sounding class components across both DietTracker and ExpenseSplitter for EYLAH*
*** What it does:
*** Justification:
*** Highlights:
*** Credits:

* *Minor enhancement*: [In Process]
** *Fixed the Calories bug that occurs when Calories are not in the desired range.*
*** What it does: Properly validates the user's Calories input for any of the Diet Tracker Commands which involve Calories.
*** Justification: Otherwise, the previously poor implementation would cause the application to crash.
*** Highlights: This was brought up during internal testing within the team and also by others during the Mock PE Testing.
It was important to fix this bug. I found that the cause of this overall bug was due to a few lapses in terms of the original implementation.
The original implementation had failed to consider a VALIDATION_REGEX for the Calories String itself, since Calories was built using a long instead of directly from a String.
This caused problems when typing unknown characters that were not longs. Another issue was that you could exceed in the input long for Calories which would crash the program also.
This was circumvented using BigInteger when validating the long.

1. is BigDecimal the best way to represent currency? +
2. under ItemPriceTest, instead of assertFalse can I assertThrows because BigDecimal
will throw an exception? Because in AB3 everything there is assertFalse +
