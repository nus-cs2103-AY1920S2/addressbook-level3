---

== Overview

ResuMe is a resume managing application made specifically for University students by University Students to allow then
to add and manage their different experiences, edit personal data, and create the resume of their dreams in just a few
commands.

== Summary of contributions

=== Code contributed:
Link to my code [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=helloimhai&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[Code]]

=== Contribution to team based tasks:

==== Morphed Commands in overall architecture
* What it means: Commands that are item dependent are now separated to their own separate class according to the item
type that they modify, to be created by parser and calls on changes in the model.
* Justification: This is to make sure that the logic of each excution of each command class is independent from the
type that it is linked to. Eg. ListCommand is split into ListResumeCommand and ListSkillCommand... ListXYZCommand will
show all XYZ without having to check what Item type is passed into it.

==== Set up the foundation for tests
Created typical classes, item builders, assert command success and failure to aid the team in the setting up of tests.

==== Manage releases
managed releases for release v1.3 and v1.4.

=== Enhancements implemented:
==== Preview a resume: `rpreview`
* What it does: Allows users to preview their fleshed out resume in the application before generating it.
* Justification: This was done to provide users with a ability to go check their resumes for any typos or make sure
that all their relevant experiences have been added to the resume before actually making it into a PDF file. This will
save users' time as generating the PDF does take some time, and decrease the clutter as users would not have to
generate many files.
* Highlights: This feature wrote the framework to to pass data back to UI and allow the creation of the window with
the text data. This feature made enhancing the `help` command much easier due to similar logic and styling.

==== List all items: `list`
* What it does: Allows users to view all items of a certain type.
* Justification: This is done so that users know what items they have to pick and choose from to add into their resume.
* Highlights: Bigger rework on UI and CommandResult so that CommandResult passes up the type currently showing for UI
to update and give visual feedback to users.

==== Clear all data: `clear`
* What it does: Allows users clear all their data to start fresh.
* Highlights: This feature was morphed from AddressBook so that it can work with our data types, undo, and redo.

==== Wrote tests for `add`, `clear`, `done`, `list`, `rpreview`, `view`, `JsonAdaptedInternship`, `EditUserCommand`...
* Played an integral role in pulling coverage up from 23% to 83%.
