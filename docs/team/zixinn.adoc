== PROJECT: Mod Manager

== Overview

This document documents my contributions to Mod Manager.

Mod Manager is a desktop application that assists students in managing tasks, schedules and contacts for their modules. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

Mod Manager is morphed from existing desktop Java application https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/addressbook-level3[Address Book (Level 3)] over a period of 8 weeks by my team of 5 software engineering students.

== Summary of Contributions

Given below is a summary of my contributions to Mod Manager.

*Major enhancement*:

* Implemented the module management feature.
** What it does: This feature allows users to add, view, edit and delete modules.
** Justification: This feature improves the product as it enables users to manage modules easily. It gathers all the information for each module and displays them to the user.
** Highlights: This enhancement required integration of the other features. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as it required updating the classes, tasks and facilitators when a module is edited or deleted.

*Minor enhancement*:

* Refactored person in Address Book to facilitator in Mod Manager.
* Implemented the ability to bring users to the relevant tabs when commands are executed.
