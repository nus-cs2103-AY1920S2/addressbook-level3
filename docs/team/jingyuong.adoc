== PROJECT: Modulo

---

== Overview

Modulo is for *NUS students* who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their school work on a modular level*.
It helps you to break down your modules into deadlines and track their progress. +

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to update a deadline status to be done or not done*
** What it does: allows the user to keep track of their deadlines and update them easily.
When user added module and events, a deadline will be auto populated to each event.
Therefore, user can view the deadline for every week and update them if it is not completed.
This actually help user not to miss any assignment and deadline.

** Justification: When user added module and events, a deadline will be auto populated to each event.
Therefore, user can view the deadline for every week and update them if it is not completed.
This actually help user not to miss any assignment and deadline.
** Highlights: This features required multi layer of checking for modules and events in order to update the status of the deadline.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the right panel for UI and wire up the logic for viewing details for modules / details + deadlines for events
