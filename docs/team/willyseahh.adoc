== PROJECT: EYLAH

---

== Overview

This project portfolio details my key contributions to the team software engineering project, EYLAH. The team consists
of five Year 2 Computer Science undergraduates in the National University of Singapore (NUS), including myself.

We were given six weeks to either morph or enhance an existing Java project, Address Book.
We chose to morph the project into EYLAH, a desktop application specifically
programmed for students staying in Temasek Hall at the National University
of Singapore. It aims to ease their lives
at halls by providing them with an application that *split bills easily* and *help
them track their diet*.
The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

My role was to build the Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH and ensure that our project
is on schedule for completion.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:

. Adding of *Item, ItemPrice, ItemName for the Expense Splitter* portion of EYLAH
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/127[#127])

*** *What it does:* +
Allows the user to perform the `additem` command successfully hence adding an Entry which consists
of an Item into the current Receipt.

*** *Justification:* +
These classes are crucial for Expense Splitter to work because this allows the User
to input an Item to split among his friends, the crux of Expense Splitter.

*** *Highlights:* +
Implementing the ItemPrice was a little tricky because Double should not be used to hold Currency
as it will lead to rounding errors.
Upon further research on Stack Overflow, I have decided that BigDecimal will be a better type to hold currency.

*** *Credits:* +
Online links where I researched on: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1359817/using-bigdecimal-to-work-with-currencies"


. Added *the ability to deduct Amount owed by a Person when they have paid through `paid` command*
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/176[#176])

*** *What it does:* +
Allows the user to reduce the amount owed by a Person.

*** *Justification:* +
This feature allows a Person to clear his/her debt. In EYLAH after a Person has cleared his/her debt, their
name will be deleted to prevent cluttering of names which may confuse the user. Thus it is important to have a feature which reduces the
amount of money owed by a Person.


*** *Highlights:* +
This enhancement helped our team discover a rather major bug with Expense Splitter workflow. In the event where
the user accidentally delete an item in the receipt after his/her peers has paid the user, EYLAH will not work as intended.
Fortunately, we
resolved it by not allowing users to use the `paid` command until after a receipt has been finalised.


. Added *the expense splitter
storage component that allowed the user to automatically save a Person and their amount owed after
each command*
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/148[#148])

*** *What it does:* +
Allows EYLAH to save a Person and the amount they owe after each command.

*** *Justification:* +
This feature allows the user to automatically save the amount of money each person owes him after every command.
This is important so the user do not have to manually input every entry again in the unlikely event where EYLAH crash.

*** *Highlights:* +
Ability to save a Person name and their amount owed automatically.

* *Minor enhancement*:

. Modified the `paid` command to allow a Person to pay his debt fully +
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/209[#209])

*** *What it does:* +
Expanded the `paid` command to accept empty amount field, which meant that the Person paid his debt fully. +
Previously: `paid 1 3` meant that person at INDEX 1 paid $3. +
Now: `paid 1` meant that person at INDEX 1 paid the full amount he owes.

*** *Justification:* +
This allows the user to conveniently clear a Person debt fully.

. Performed defensive coding for `additem` command and `paid` command +
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/352[#352])

*** *What it does:* +
`additem` and `paid` commands are commands in expense splitter
which includes numerical digits and multiple parameters. As a result, these commands may be exploited
when discovering bugs in EYLAH. Common issues includes passing a huge numerical number which causes Integer Overflow
or passing a negative index which causes ArrayOutOfBounds Exceptions. Thus I handled these rouge commands by
including try-catch statement to catch these exceptions.

*** *Justification:* +
This reduces the chances of EYLAH crashing.
