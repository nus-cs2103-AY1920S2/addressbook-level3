them track their diet. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: [In Process]
** What it does:
** Justification:
** Highlights:
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

** *Adding of ItemClass, ItemPrice, ItemName for the Expense Splitter portion of EYLAH*
*** What it does: Item is used when User wants to calculate how much each Person(s) must pay for that Item.
*** Justifcation:
*** Highlights: Implementing the ItemPrice was a little tricky because Double should not be used to hold Currency as it will lead to rounding errors. Upon further research on Stack Overflow, I decided that BigDecimal will be a better type to hold currency
*** Credits: Online links where I researched on: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1359817/using-bigdecimal-to-work-with-currencies"

Questions to ask: +
1. is BigDecimal the best way to represent currency? +
2. under ItemPriceTest, instead of assertFalse can I assertThrows because BigDecimal
will throw an exception? Because in AB3 everything there is assertFalse +
3.
