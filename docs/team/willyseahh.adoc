== PROJECT: EYLAH

---

== Overview

EYLAH is a desktop application specifically programmed for students staying in National University
of Singapore. It aims to ease their lives
at halls by providing them with an application that split bills easily and help
them track their diet. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:

. Adding of *Item, ItemPrice, ItemName for the Expense Splitter* portion of EYLAH
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/issues/121[#121])

*** *What it does:* +
Allows the user to perform the `additem` command successfully hence adding an Entry which consists
of an Item into the current Receipt.

*** *Justification:* +
These classes are crucial for Expense Splitter to work because this the User
has to input an Item to split among his friends.

*** *Highlights:* +
Implementing the ItemPrice was a little tricky because Double should not be used to hold Currency
as it will lead to rounding errors.
Upon further research on Stack Overflow, I have decided that BigDecimal will be a better type to hold currency.


*** *Credits:* +
Online links where I researched on: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1359817/using-bigdecimal-to-work-with-currencies"

. Added *the ability to deduct Amount owed by a Person when they have paid*

*** *What it does:* +
Allows the user to reduce the amount owed by a Person.
(Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/issues/195[#195])

*** *Justification:* +
This feature allows a Person to clear his/her debt. In EYLAH after a Person has cleared his/her debt, their
name will be deleted to prevent cluttering of names which may confuse the user. Thus it is important to have a feature which reduces the
amount of money owed by a Person.


*** *Highlights:* +
This enhancement helped our team discover a rather major bug with Expense Splitter workflow. Fortunately, we
resolved it by not allowing users to use the `paid` command until after a receipt has been finalised.
*** *Credits:* +
N.A

. Added *the storage component that allowed the user to automatically save a Person and their amount owed after
each command*

*** *Justification:* +
This feature allows the user to automatically save the amount of money each person owes him after every command.
This is important so the user do not have to manually input every entry again in the unlikely event where EYLAH crash.

*** *Highlights:* +
Ability to save a Person name and their amount owed automatically.

*** *Credits:* +
N.A
