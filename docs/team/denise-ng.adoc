== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancements*:
** Added *the ability to search for coupons by its expiry date/ month year*
(Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/82[#82]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/198[#198]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/202[#202])
*** What it does: Allows the user to view all his/ her coupons by the expiry date or the month.
*** Justification: This feature is essential for users to keep track of the expiry dates of coupons. The enhancement,
with the calendar, will ensure that users know exactly when their coupons expire and will never forget to use them.
*** Highlights: This enhancement ties in closely with the calendar, which indicates if there is any coupon expiring on
each date.
It also ties in with other coupon fields to ensure the validity of a coupon (i.e. not expired), such as savings from
the coupon. This feature is critical to the functioning of Coupon Stash as it directly affects the primary functions of
Coupon Stash such as the automatic archiving of expired coupons and setting of a reminder 3 days before the expiry date.

** Added *Calendar Pane* (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/123[#123])
*** What it does: allows user to have a bird eye's view of the expiry dates of his/ her coupons on the calendar.
*** Justification: This feature is important for users to have a clearer view of the expiry dates of coupons with
highlights on the calendar.
*** Highlights: This enhancement ties in closely with expiry date, as the calendar will highlight a date on the calendar
if there is any coupon expiring on the specific date.
The Calendar Pane changes with the observable list in the coupon list panel, which follows the Observer Design Pattern.


* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added start date field that allows coupons to have a starting date & to tie in with the expiry date (Pull requests

, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/226[#226])

** Added the copy command that allows the user to copy the details of a coupon as an add command to the user's
clipboard (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/134[#134]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/198[#198] (Renamed from export to copy))

** Added the goto command that allows the user to navigate the calendar using the Command Line
Interface (CLI) (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/202[#202])
