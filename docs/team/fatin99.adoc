== PROJECT: TA-Tracker

---

== Overview

*TA-Tracker* is a productivity tool made for NUS School of Computing Teaching Assistants (TAs). Rather than using
several excel spreadsheets or notes, *TA-Tracker* enables TAs to manage their students and track teaching duties in a
single, convenient-to-use platform . The application is mainly written in *Java* and spans a considerable *20k Lines of
Code*. With a rigorous system of checks and tests put in place, users can be assured that the codebase is
well-maintained, and that the code quality is consistently high. A comprehensive set of guides are also provided to
ensure a smooth on-boarding process for both users and contributors alike.

== Summary of contributions

As the main developer of the applicationâ€™s `User Interface` (UI), I play a crucial role in integrating the features my
teammates create with the `UI`. During group discussions, I placed extra emphasis on guiding my teammates to engineer
solutions that could be more easily assimilated into the `UI`, to ensure that their work becomes user-visible. As a
result, my team was able to morph the given codebase from a trivial application into a polished product.

With the substantial amount of experience I gained while designing the application, I was available and prepared to help
out with various tasks, like design considerations and debugging. As the most experienced `UI` developer in the team, I
was highly involved in helping my teammates become more familiar with *JavaFX* and *CSS*. My role in the development of the
project was especially crucial, as I enabled my teammates to be able to display all the hard work that they have put
into the development of their respective features to the users. My major contributions are as follows:

=== Updated the User Interface

The `UI` is at the heart of *TA-Tracker*, displaying the output of *TA-Tracker* to the user visually. As the main contributor
to the `MainWindow` of the `UI`, I play an integral role in ensuring that the content is being displayed to the user
correctly, while keeping the interface simple and informative. I changed the overall layout of *TA-Tracker* by adding
tabs and icons (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/120[#120]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/182[#182]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/227[#227]
), and by creating all the `ListPanels` and their respective `ListCards` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/120[#120]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/182[#182]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/204[#204]
).

I also took care to ensure that the information displayed was integrated with the _BackEnd_ whenever my
teammates made new contributions to the application, such as adding new fields (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/322[#322]
) or commands (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/330[#330]
). A `Total
Earnings` label in the `Claims Tab` was also added to improve user experience, as money makes the world go round (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/243[#243]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/322[#322]
).

=== Enabled highlighting of applied filters

As *TA-Tracker* was initially based on *AB3*, the `UI` at the beginning of the project looked plain and dull. Instead of
indiscriminately adding colours to *TA-Tracker*, I favoured a different approach, and enabled the relevant `ListCells` in
the `Student Tab` and `Claims Tab` to be highlighted whenever `filter` commands were entered (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/210[#210]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/227[#227]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/235[#235]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/238[#238]
). This
not only made a huge improvement in the visual differences between *TA-Tracker* and *AB3*, but also enabled users to better
focus on the information displayed.

This contribution also required extensive debugging and improvements to the inner workings of the `FilterCommand`, which
was a rather challenging command to implement (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/243[#243]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/314[#314]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/322[#322]
). In the `Session Tab`, highlighting the `ListCells` was a
less favourable option, since there was only one `ListPanel` to display. I overcame this challenge by creating a `filter
header` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/322[#322]
).

=== Implemented relevant commands to improve User Experience

*Goto Command* : To achieve the goal of making TA-Tracker a _keyboard-only application_, I implemented the `GoToCommand`
to allow users to switch between tabs via the command-line rather than clicking on the tab-headers (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/189[#189]
).

In a similar spirit, I enabled *switching to relevant tabs for all commands*, to better the user experience. This allows
new information to be displayed instantaneously upon entering a command (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/189[#189]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/210[#210]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/212[#212]
). This involved
creating an `enum` for `UI` handling in `CommandResult` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/189[#189]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/212[#212]
) and as a result, the painstaking process of updating the
entire code-base.

*SetRate Command* : The hourly pay rate for all the displayed `Earnings` was initially set to $40, which is the rate at
which the majority of TAs are being paid. Based on feedback from the PE Dry-Run, I created a command to change this value
due to the possibility of changes being made to the hourly pay rate. (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/321[#321]
)

=== Other UI Improvements

I also contributed to the development of `HelpWindow` and `StatisticsWindow` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/227[#227]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/235[#235]
) by fixing sizing issues and
adding `ScrollPanes`. Moreover, I included the option to close both windows by pressing the *ESC* key to achieve
the goal of making TA-Tracker a _keyboard-only application_ (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/236[#236]
).

=== Added extensive automated tests

I made thorough *JUnit* tests for the `StudentCommand`, `StudentCommandParser`,
and `Student` as well as its relevant `fields`.
(https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/340[#340]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/341[#341]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/347[#347]
)

=== Improved overall code quality

* Packaged all `Commands`, `Parsers`, `Models` and `UI` components (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/143[#143]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/212[#212]
)
* General quality fixes to the entire code-base based on *Codacy* reports (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/350[#350]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/351[#351]
)
* Created `enum` classes for `SessionType` and `GroupType` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/120[#120]
, https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/182[#182]
)

=== Other contributions

* Created a skeleton for the `DeleteStudentCommand` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/113[#113]
)
* Removed the requirement for compulsory `Phone` and `Email` fields in `AddStudentCommand` (https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/146[#146]
)
* Managed the project by commenting on critical pull requests (various)

* Handled release of `Ver 1.2`
