=== PROJECT: Naggy Joel

---

=== Overview

*Naggy Joel* is a desktop social life manager application for University students to manage their social life and studies. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. *Naggy Joel* allows users to keep track of contacts, restaurants, school deadlines, and events - 4 different but closely related aspects of a University student's life.

=== Summary of contributions
==== Major Enhancements
* *Added the feature to allow users to `add/edit/delete` restaurants*
** What it does: Allows the user to `add/edit/delete` a restaurant with the specified name, location, visited status, type of cuisine, price point, and operating hours
** Justification: Other then keeping contacts, students might want to take note of goods restaurants that they visited and restaurants that open at odd hours (when they need food studying late) and these features allow the student to do that
** Highlights 1: This set of enhancements comprise a huge amount of code as it required building the Restaurant and RestaurantBook model from scratch, this also required a thorough understanding of restaurants and how they differ from contacts
** Highlights 2: To maintain consistency of the code, an in-depth understanding of RegEx expressions for validation of input parameters was also required and had to be learnt
** Credits: _{referenced the original AddressBook and Person model}_

* *Added the feature to allow users to `undo/redo` previous commands*
** What it does: Allows the user to `undo` all previous commands one at a time; preceding `undo` commands can be reversed by using the `redo` command
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and this provides a convenient way for users to rectify them
** Highlights 1: This enhancement affects exiting and future commands, and hence required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives (for example, how do we want to modify ModelManager, how do we want to store the states, what is the impact on memory, what are the commands that changes the state, etc)
** Highlights 2: The implementation was also challenging as it required a manual inspection and changing of the 20 commands that changes the state of the model (for example, adding an item into an ArrayList had to be done by first creating a new ArrayList and copying all existing items instead of simply adding the new item into the ArrayList, etc)
** Highlights 3: This enhancement also had to consider what was shown on the GUI as an indication/confirmation to the user that the command was indeed undone/redone

==== Minor Enhancements
* *Edited the `edit/addnote/editnote/deletenote` command for AddressBook*
** What it does: Shows the details of the contact edited upon successful command execution
** Justification: The list of contact shows only the name, tags, and phone number; showing the user the details of these contacts when the user edits the user provides visual confirmation of the successful execution of the commands
** Highlights: These 4 commands that show the details of a contact changes the state of the data while the `(ab)get` command does not change the state of the data; hence a careful distinction between the 2 is essential to ensuring `undo/redo` works properly

* *Reworked the `clear` command to clear all entries from the entire application*
** What it does: Clears all entries in the entire application instead of just the AddressBook
** Justification: `clear` as intuitively understood should be to clear the entire application and not just one portion (AddressBook) of the application
** Highlights: As the only command that does more than modifies more than 1 area of the model (clears AddressBook, RestaurantBook, SchoolworkTracker, EventTracker), it had to be implemented properly to trigger only 1 state change, and not 4 for `undo/redo` to work properly
