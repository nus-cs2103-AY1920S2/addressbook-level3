== PROJECT: Nice and Amazing Student Assistant (NASA)

---

== Overview

Nice & Amazing Student Assistant (NASA) is an application for busy university students to manage their module
assignments, lessons, exams and other miscellaneous activities.

NASA has a user-centric Graphical User Interface optimized for users who prefer to work with the
Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, NASA can keep track of all your module activities faster than
traditional GUI applications.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the ability to export data on NASA via QR code*
** What it does: allows the user to export their deadlines and events by scanning the generated QR code with any QR code enabled scanners and smartphones.
** Justification: This feature allows users to copy their deadlines and events to their phone conveniently, for easy reference on their mobile devices.
** Highlights: This enhancement utilises ZXing, a 3rd party library, which outputs a QR code from an input byte array. A solid understanding of parsing strings to byte array, and rendering the resultant byte array as an image is needed. In the UI implementation, the resolution of the QR code is adjusted according to the amount of data contained by the QR code to optimise QR code scan success rate.
** Credits: ZXing

* *Minor enhancement*: Added *sorting of deadline and events via various sort criteria like name, due date, and priority.* This helps the user to navigate their deadlines and events with ease.
