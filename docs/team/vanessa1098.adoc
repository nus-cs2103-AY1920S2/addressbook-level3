== PROJECT: Naggy Joel

---

== Overview

Naggy Joel is a desktop application used by University students to manage social life. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

It is an application that allows users to manage all aspects of their social life, ranging from your different social circles and contacts, to events, all without compromising on academic life.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major enhancement:
* *Added the ability to add/edit/delete note commands for each contact*
** What it does: Allows the user to add multiple notes, edit the added notes, or delete the added notes.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can add in additional information to a contact that they wish to remember/ is deemed important.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
** Credits: _{reused the original RemarkCommand}_

* *Added the ability to add/edit/delete note commands for each restaurant*
** What it does: Allows the user to add multiple notes, edit the added notes, or delete the added notes.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can add additional information to a restaurant in order to keep track of the dishes' reviews.
** Highlights: Each restaurant has 3 food notes that can be added, edited, or deleted. Multiple addition/deletion of notes require a detailed validity check of the command since the inputs are dependent.
** Credits: _{referenced from RemarkCommand}_

* *Added the ability to retrieve a single particular contact.*
** What it does: This allows the user to view the information of a particular contact in full detail.
** Justification: As we added in more fields to a person in the Address Book, we cut down the information displayed on the Address Book list command. Thus, this command allows the user to view the rest of the information.
** Highlights:
*** This enhancement requires the understanding of how the filtering of the Address Book contacts are done, and to display it on the application.
*** Independent filtering is required. To retrieve a single contact information on a third display panel, the filtering of the Address Book contacts should not affect the original contact list on the second panel.

=== Minor enhancement:
* *Added the ability to sort assignments*
** What it does: This allows the user to sort the assignments by deadline or estimated number of hours to be completed, or by the assignment's title in alphabetical order.
** Justification: As our application allows user to keep track of the assignments that they have to complete, providing a sorting feature allows for prioritisation of assignments based on the criteria (deadline/time needed) the user prefers.
** Highlights: Uncompleted assignments, assignments with the most recent deadline and take a longer time to complete will be listed first.

* *Ensure that the filtered search results remains after editing of contacts/restaurants*
** What it does: After a user enters `(ab)find` or `(rt)find` and wish to edit information of the contacts/restaurants in this search result, the filtered search result will still remain on the second panel even with the edits.
** Justification: This helps to complement the commands and allows the user to have the option to return to the full list of contacts/remain the filtered search results after any edits.
