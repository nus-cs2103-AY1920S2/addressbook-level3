== PROJECT: Cooking Papa

---

== Overview

Cooking Papa is a desktop cookbook application used to manage recipes and ingredients for cooking. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the ability to cook a recipe using inventory ingredients
** What it does: Allows the user to remove the ingredients in the inventory after cooking a specific recipe inside CookingPapa.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to remove recipe's ingredients effectively without
having the user to remove the each ingredient separately.
** Highlights: This enhancement will be one of the most used feature as this application is mainly to aid cooking experience.
This enhancement helps to integrate the `Cookbook` and `Inventory` systems together to provide a all-in-one application
which make this enhancement challenging also.
** Credits: The implementation of the `Inventory` and `Cookbook` classes was a team effort which is vital to the successful
implementation of this feature.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Contributed to basic structure of `Step` and `Tag` classes in recipe.
** Contributed to basic `Recipe` command classes such as managing tag and steps in a recipe.
