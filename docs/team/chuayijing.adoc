== PROJECT: TA-Tracker

== OverView

This portfolio seeks to document my contributions to our team's project, TA-Tracker.
Ta-Tracker is a productivity tool designed for NUS School of Computing
Teaching Assistants (TAs).
TAs can track and manage all their claimable hours and the students
they are teaching in one place.

== About this portfolio
This project portfolio details my individual contributions to the TA-Tracker project.
It includes a summary of the enhancements and other contributions I made throughout
the duration of the project. Additionally, portions of my contribution to the User Guide
and Developer Guide have also been included.

== Summary of contributions

The contributions I have made towards the team project are detailed in this section.

=== Major Enhancement: I added the ability to filter under each view.

* *What it does*: The `filter` command allows the user to search for relevant information
under the different views.
** Under the Student View, there is `FilterStudentCommand` to filter the students.
** Under the Session View, there is `FilterSessionCommand` to filter the sessions.
** Under the Claims View, there is `FilterClaimCommand` to filter the claims.

* *Justification*: This is a necessary feature for a system that manages
a lot of data. Sometimes, users only need to view specific information.
That is when the `filter` command is handy.

* *Highlights*: This enhancement affects existing commands and has to support future commands.
Since the filtering works differently under the different views,
the implementation of each filter command is different. The implementation was
challenging as it required a lot of changes to the existing find command in AB3.
Furthermore, there was a need to ensure that certain restrictions are met
before doing the filtering to ensure that our codebase is consistent.

==== Major Enhancement: Recurring Sessions.

* *What it does*:
Recurring sessions allows TAs to mark a session as recurring so they don't have to enter
it again and again.
When the TA marks a recurring session as done, a new session with the updated date
will be added to the list of sessions.

* *Justification*: Certain tasks that TAs have are weekly, such as weekly tutorials.
 This feature makes TA-Tracker more user-friendly as the
user does not have to key in the same details for a session every week manually.

* *Highlights*: This feature was difficult to implement as there were several considerations to be
taken care of. Furthermore, it had been implemented in a different way. We initially
assumed that recurring lessons would be on a weekly basis. However, we realised that we
should not make that assumption. Significant changes were made in order to allow TAs to indicate
the number of recurring weeks that they want.

==== Other Minor Enhancements : Session related commands.

* *Justifications*: `AddSessionCommand`, `DeleteSessionCommand` and `list` commands
are essential for TAs to manipulate data in Session View.

* *Highlights*: While they are minor enhancements, implementation of these commands have
to be thorough. This is because there are many small details to take note of.
One example is the sorting of sessions when TA adds a new session.
Sessions shown to TA have to be sorted based on date, start time and end time of sessions.

== Other Contributions:

* Enhancements to existing features:

**  I wrote additional tests for existing features to increase
coverage from 58% to 61%
(Pull request: https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/343[#343])

** I fixed bugs reported by test users of the application.
(Pull requests: https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main/pull/339[#339],

== Contributions to the User Guide
We wrote a User Guide targeted at the users of TA-Tracker.
The User Guide contains instructions on how to use the various commands
of the application. The following is an excerpt from our User Guide,
showing additions that I have made for `filter` and `Session` features.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide

In addition to a User Guide, we wrote a Developer Guide
targeted at developers who are interested in contributing to the project.
The Developer Guide showcases my ability to write technical documentation
and the technical depth of my contributions to the project.
Given below is my contribution to the Developer Guide:
