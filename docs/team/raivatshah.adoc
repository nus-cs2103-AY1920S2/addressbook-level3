== PROJECT: CoderLifeInsights
CoderLifeInsights (CLI) is a desktop application that provides you insights and suggestions to your social life as a programmer using a CLI (Command Line Interface)

---

== My Role
I am responsible to complete the features related to group and overall system design. Furthermore, I've worked extensively on the storage package and
developed the JSON implementations for group and event classes.
I have also made notable contributions to the User Guide and Developer Guide.

== Summary of contributions
=== Major enhancements:
* *Major enhancement #1*: Implemented group features - `add_group`, `delete_group`, `edit_group` and `list_groups`
** What they do: They allow the user of CoderLifeInsights to add a social group, delete a social group or edit the
group for adding/removing members or changing the name of the group. The `list_group` command lists all the groups in the app.
It was planned and implemented in anticipation of a `find_group` command in the future that could change the group list view in the app.
** Justification: A social group is a crucial aspect of the
CoderLifeInsights app as it allows the users to distinguish between time spent in group interactions and individual,
one-to-one interactions. The group features are essential to record and track data regarding social groups. The commands
are implemented similar to `add_person`, `delete_person` and `edit_person`
features of the addressbook3 due to the clear design and defensive programming style.
** Highlights: This enhancement functions well with existing commands and adds a crucial ability to add social groups. It required an in-depth analysis
of design alternatives.
** Credits: As highlighted above, the group features take inspiration from the person features of addressbook3. Thus,
credits go to the previous developers of addressbook3 for the system design and class structures.

* *Major enhancement #2*: Implemented storage features - JSON Implementations for Event and Group
** What it does: JSON implementations allow the app to store and retrieve data from file. This is crucial as the app is
not expected to always run and needs to store data in the hard disk.
** Justification: Using the JSON implementations, the app can go back to its last state when a user
re-launches the app.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth understanding of JSON and Java Data structures in order to convert
between Java Classes such as `Group` and `Event` and JSON implementations which stored strings.

=== Minor enhancements:
* *Minor enhancement #1*: Implemented Unique Event List
** What it does: Stores unique Event instances
** Justification: Since events are crucial to social interactions, storing events is important for the purpose of tracking.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth understanding of the JavaFX Observable class.

* *Minor enhancement #2*: Implemented Time Class
** What is does: Allows the user to store a specific time spent in terms of number of hours and minutes.
** Justification: The constraints the in the class allow for efficient management of time format, which suites the
customised need of the app.
** Highlights: This enhancement functions well with all the classes that depend upon it and use it. This required a
thorough understanding of the different use cases.

** Tools:
*** Integrated https://www.codacy.com/[Codacy] to automate code quality checks
*** Used Creately to create initial class diagrams to visualise the relationship between Objects (Person, Group, Event)
and their UniqueLists. The diagram can be viewed https://app.creately.com/diagram/SaOxsebie1n/[here.]

** Rough UI:
*** To visualise the app UI before actually creating it, I used https://www.sketch.com/[Sketch App] to create a
rough UI of the app. The team used the rough UI as a guide. The UI can be viewed https://www.raivat.dev/UI.pdf[here.]
