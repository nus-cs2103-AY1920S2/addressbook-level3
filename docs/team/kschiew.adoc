== PROJECT: FlashSpeed

---

== Overview

FlashSpeed is a text-based flashcard application specifically designed for university students
who are learning a foreign language.
University students often have hectic schedules.
With this in mind,
FlashSpeed was created to allow students to be able to study and revise foreign vocabulary on the fly.

FlashSpeed was developed as a team project for the CS2103T Software Engineering module in the National University of Singapore
(NUS). It is considered a brownfield project as it was built on top of the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the https://se-education.org[SE-EDU initiative].
FlashSpeed is written in Java and has a GUI created using https://openjfx.io/[JavaFX], with a storage system implemented using
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson].


== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement 1*: designed the *architecture* of the app.
** What it does: creates the backbone structure of the application.
** Justification: This contribution is critical to the development of the product
because it created the basic structure of the app as well as designed the logic of the application,
so that different features could be developed simultaneously.
** Highlights: This contribution sets the tone of the application.
It required an in-depth analysis of how the application should work in the future.
The implementation too was challenging as it required making high-level design choices.
** Credits: Some of the high-level structure of FlashSpeed is inspired by Anki, a digital flashcard application.

* *Major enhancement 2*: added the *storage function* to the app.
** What it does: allows the user to save and load the decks of cards created by the user to/from a local directory.
** Justification: This feature improves the usability of the product significantly
because a user needs to be able to retrieve the decks of cards that he/she has created in the past.
** Highlights: This enhancement requires an deep understanding of how JSON files and the Jackson library.
The implementation was quite challenging as there are quite a few layers of abstraction in the storage system
implemented by the original project that FlashSpeed is built upon.

* *Major enhancement 3*: added the ability to *generate statistics* after every game session.
** What it does: allows the user to look at the statistics related to the game session that he/she played.
** Justification: This feature increases the usage rate of the app,
because it provides a feedback on the performance of the user.
By quantifying the performance, this gives user motivation to do better in subsequent game sessions.
Thus, the user will start more game sessions and hence the app
usage time will increase.
** Highlights: The difficulty was manageable,
as most of the enhancement was essentially arithmetic manipulation.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implemented the library class that contains the decks of cards along with another teammate,
LiXin. Built and enhanced the Model and Logic Component with Amirul and LiXin.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=kschiew&tabRepo=AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Functional and Test code]]
