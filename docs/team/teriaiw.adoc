image::../images/Ui.png[]

== Overview

iGrad is a desktop module management and graduation tracking application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and
it has a GUI created with JavaFX, FXML and CSS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major Enhancement*: added feature to *calculate C.A.P. to achieve desired C.A.P.*
** What it does: allows the user to get an estimate of what C.A.P. they should expect to maintain per semester to
achieve the desired C.A.P. that they want.
** Justification: This feature allows users to better keep track and aim for better grades.
It provides added convenience for users as it uses existing data that user has already input.
** Highlights: Consideration for unachievable C.A.P. was included

* *Major Enhancement*: Integrate *Semesters tracking* under course management feature
** What it does: tracking of how many semesters a user has left for their course of study, calculated based
on total semesters that user has input and completed semesters based on modules completed.
** Justification: This feature provides convenience to users as it allows the user to know of such information without
additional calculations. Therefore, it adds to user experience. This feature is also necessary for the calculation
of C.A.P. feature.
** Highlights: Tracking does not require any additional input by user, and is updated automatically on the UI.
** Credits: http://github.com/waynewee[Wayne] for integrating backend to frontend functionality
