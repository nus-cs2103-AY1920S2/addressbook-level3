== PROJECT: NOVA

== Overview

NOVA is a desktop application to help CS2103T with event planning, managing schedules and keeping track of their project tasks.

== Summary of contributions

I am in charge of the Progress Tracker and its features and is a maintainer for the team repo.

* *Major enhancement*:
I added the ability to add project tasks into individual and team project.

** What it does: Allows users to add tasks into specific weeks of projects.
** Justification: This enables users to keep track of the tasks that they need to complete each week for the projects.
** Highlights: The implementation required thinking of design restrictions such as having only 13 weeks since there are
only 13 weeks in a semester before project submission as well as having only two projects in the module.
** Credits: The parsers used for the commands were modified versions of the parsers from AddressBook 3.

* *Major enhancement*:
I added the ability to navigate between the different features.

** What it does: Allows users to navigate to the different features of the application.
** Justification: This enables the team to reuse command keywords since the parsers and commands can be separate now.
This also enables users to receive feature specific information such as specific error messages and helpbox at the side.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the parsers and command keywords that is available to the team to use.
This also helped reduce the dependency of the different features and helped to link the different customisation and parsers
together.

* *Minor enhancement*:
I added the ability to list tasks from a specific week of the projects. This allows the user to view the tasks that they
have added.

* *Minor enhancement*:
I added the ability to delete tasks. This allows the user to delete the tasks that they
have added so that they can fix errors they made.

* *Minor enhancement*:
I added the ability to edit tasks. This allows the user to edit the tasks that they
have added so that they can fix minor errors they made without having to delete and re-add tasks.

* *Minor enhancement*:
I added the ability to add a note to tasks. This allows users to add additional information to a task.

* *Minor enhancement*:
I added the ability to delete note to tasks. This allows user to delete note that have been wrongly added.

* *Minor enhancement*:
I added the ability to edit note added to tasks. This allows user to make corrections to errors in notes without having
to delete and re-add a note.
