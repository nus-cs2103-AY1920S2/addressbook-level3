== PROJECT: iTrack Pro

---

== Overview

iTrack Pro is for the grocery shop owners to keep track of the products, customers, and transactions of the shop and have a better understanding of the business by viewing the performance of products and behaviors of customers. It is also able to provide an analysis of the entire business to help the owner manage the shop.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
1. Added *the ability to manage products (add, list, find, delete, clear, edit)*
** What it does: allows the user to manage products in the inventory easily. User can add, delete or edit products, and list or clear all products. Users can also find products based on keywords.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because shop owners can have many products and managing them manually can be inefficient. Hence, the inventory system provides a convenient way for them to keep track of their products.
** Highlights: Though the implementation seems similar to the `Person` class in the addressbook, it was challenging as the fields were different and the execution of some commands varied due to the different requirements.

2. Added *the ability to view and analyse statistics (revenue, profit, predict sales, view top selling products)*
** What it does: allows the user to view and analyse statistics based on transactions added to the inventory system.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because shop owners can gain insight to their business and know how profitable they are. By knowing the revenue and profit, the user can gauge market demand for their products and employ suitable marketing strategies to improve sales. Moreover, users can get the predicted sales for the next month, enabling them to make more informed business decisions.
** Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The difficult part was to determine how and when the revenue/ profit was to be calculated, and the best way to structure the classes.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added id for `Customer` and `Product` and made use of customer and product id fields to prevent duplicate transactions (during transaction edit) (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/122[#122])
** Added view top-selling products function (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/112[#112])
** Updated ui for statistics window and notification (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/130[#130], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/112[#112])
** Wrote tests for product features to increase coverage by 16.3% to 66.752% (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/82[#82])
** Wrote tests for statistics features (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/119[#119], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/97[#97])
