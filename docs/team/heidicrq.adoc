== PROJECT: Mod Manager
== Overview

For this software engineering project, my team and I were tasked with morphing https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/addressbook-level3[Address Book Level 3 (AB3)] application into a better and different product. We decided to make ModManager, which aims to help students in managing module related information such as modules, classes, tasks and facilitators. Mod Manager is made for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java and has about 25kLoC.

Below is an example of what ModManager looks like:

== Summary of contributions
This section summarizes my contribution to ModManager.

*Major enhancement*:

* Implemented the class management feature
** What it does: allows the user to add, view, edit and delete classes.
** Justification: This feature improves the product because a user can manage their classes and find upcoming class, which allow the user to better prioritize their time and prepare for their classes.
** Highlights: There is some dependency between this feature and other features. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was tough due to parsing. Since there were various arguments and command formats considered, parsing was tougher than usual.

*Minor enhancement*:

* Sorted the classes by time.
* Enhanced the aesthetics of the GUI.
