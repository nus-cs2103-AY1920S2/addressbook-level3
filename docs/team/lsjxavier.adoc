== PROJECT: FoodieBot

---

== Overview
Our team was tasked with the morphing of an existing application AddressBook3 into a new application as
part of a brown-field software engineering project.
We discussed and reached a decision to create FoodieBot, an application that ultimately focuses on every
food available in our university, National University of Singapore, in a similar vein to a food directory.

FoodieBot aims to be the missing link for students to find food in campus easily from a wide catalog. It
allows for directions, where students can find their way from their current location to the canteen with
step-by-step directions, where most mapping applications currently do not have accurate information. It
also have important features such as randomizing food options for users who are indecisive on what to eat,
a budget tracker for people to help maintain their expenditures, as well as a rate/review functionality
for their easier reference to help them remember how good a food is.

== Summary of contributions

* *Enhancement*: Added the *budget* command.
** What it does: Helps the user to maintain a budget.
** Justification: For people who often overspend on food, this function helps to give an overview of their expenditure for each budget cycle (day/week/month), as well as to limit their spending where necessary.
** Highlights: This command functions independently from the other segments of the application.
** Credits: -

* *Enhancement*: Added the *report*, *transactions*, *rate* and *review* command.
