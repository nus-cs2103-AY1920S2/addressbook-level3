== PROJECT: FoodieBot

---

== Overview

Our team were tasked with this software engineering project which we were to morph from the original Address Book Level 3 into FoodieBot.
The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

FoodieBot is a campus locator desktop application created for students or tourists in NUS to provide canteen/ food information so they can make informed decisions in getting food on campus.


Our application saves the user time by randomising food items based on their indicated preferences e.g by canteen/ location/ past preference
and has a reporting feature as the user's selection of food items are tracked.



== Summary of contributions

* *Enhancement*: added *the ability to show a list of canteens*
** What it does: display a list of canteens to the user
** Justification: In the event that the user wants to find the canteens which are available, or to identify what canteens are near them and possibly the food that the canteen sells
** Highlights: This command function lays the groundwork so that future commands can rely on information of the canteen, like food selection from the canteen stalls
