== PROJECT: CoderLifeInsights
CoderLifeInsights (CLI) is a desktop application that provides you insights and suggestions to your social life as a programmer using a CLI (Command Line Interface)

---

== My Role
I am responsible to complete the import, export features as well as the suggestion and time insights feature. Besides that I am also tasked to improve the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the application. I have also made notable contributions to the User Guide and Developer Guide.

Listed in the table below are some notations that are used throughout the document.

== Summary of contributions
=== Major enhancements:
* *Major enhancement #1*: Implemented import & export features
** What it does: It allows the user to save his CoderLifeInsights data in an external file and modifies the data before
importing it back into the application. It also allows the user to change between computers without a fear of
losing his CoderLifeInsights data.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user may have existing data before
starting to use the application and to export the CoderLifeInsights data if he/she would like to change between multiple
computers.
** Highlights: This enhancement functions well with existing commands as it adds more CoderLifeInsights into the list,
all the other features such as groups, and events are updated as well. It required an in-depth analysis
of design alternatives.

* *Major enhancement #2*: Implemented suggestion features
** What it does: It allows the user to suggest a person, place or activity from based on their existing CoderLifeInsights data.
Suggestion of person would return one person that the user spends the least time with sorted by lexicographical order of name.
Suggestion of place would return one place that the user visits the least in terms of frequency.
Suggestion of activity would return one activity that the user does the least in terms of frequency.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly simplifies the process when deciding a person to hangout with, a place to go to or an activity to do.
** Highlights: This enhancement functions well with existing commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

=== Minor enhancements:
* *Minor enhancement #1*: Redesigned user interface
** What it does: This enhancement allows the application to have a better-looking, more user-friendly colour
theme as well as allows the application window size to be resizeable.
** Justification: To better fit and light up the social life as a Coder, it would be more pleasing to view the application in a brighter color as
compared to the dark theme provided in AddressBook - Level3.
** Highlights: Window size is adjustable to fit all components in to the desired smaller window size. It allows the user to use the application in full screen mode or as a smaller window without disruption of coding productivity.

* *Minor enhancement #2*: Added view time insights feature
** What is does: This enhancement allows users to be able to view insights of individual time spent vs group time spent in the form of a pie chart.
** Justification: Users are able to gain knowledge on whether they spend more time with individuals or group as a whole.
** Highlights: This enhancement functions well with existing commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
