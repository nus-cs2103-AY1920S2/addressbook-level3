== PROJECT: Mod Manager

== Overview
This portfolio documents my contribution to Mod Manager, a software engineering project that my team of 4 and I have built under the module, CS2103T Software Engineering. Over the span of 8 weeks, Mod Manager is morphed from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/addressbook-level3[Address Book Level 3 (AB3)] and it aims to assist students in managing schedules and facilitators' contact details for their modules in a semester. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

Below are some relevant contributions I have made to the development of Mod Manager.

== Summary of Contributions
This section shows a summary of my contributions to Mod Manager.

*Major enhancement*:

* Implemented the calendar feature
** What it does:
*** Allows users to view their schedules for the current week and upcoming week.
*** Allows users to find time periods where the user will be free.
** Justification: This feature improves the product because users may need a better visualisation of the many tasks and classes they have in each day in a week and know the time periods where they are free. This then allows users to better plan their schedules.
** Highlights: This enhancement has some dependency on other features. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation is hard because the calendar has to be updated whenever classes and tasks are updated due to other commands.

*Minor enhancement*:

* Sorted the facilitators in facilitators list by their name in alphabetical order.
* Design and implement the Ui for module tab.
