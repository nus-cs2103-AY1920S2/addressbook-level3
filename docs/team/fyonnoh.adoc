== PROJECT: BB Productive - Level 3

---

== Overview

My team and I were tasked to create an enhanced application that is built upon a basic command line interface called AddressBook. And thus, We created BB Productive, a productivity application that consists of three main features: a task manager, a Pomodoro timer and a Pet. We augmented the list feature of AddressBook and transform it into a task manager with a reminder system. We also added a pomodoro timer which users can use to manage his work cycle. Furthermore, we gamified productivity by retrofitting a virtual pet that would evolve as more tasks is done by the user. It would also become angry if the user has not been productive for a period of time. BB Productive is perfect for students who are procrastinators and are lazy.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: The Virtual Pet
** What it does: The Pet is part of the gamification of our application to help them be more productive. When the user completes a task, he/she gains 5 XP points. When the user completes a 25 minutes of work, tracked by the Pomodoro timer, he/she gains 25 XP points. As the user accumulates points, the pet will evolve whenever the points reach a milestone. Furthermore, if the user does not do any work (no completed task) for 24 hours, the pet will change its mood to be angry, which signals to the user that he/she has not been productive. The pet will switch back to being happy once the user finished a task.
** Justification: The purpose of this pet is to gamify productivity so as to help them overcome the inertia to doing work. The userâ€™s sense of attachment to the virtual pet acts as a source of motivation for them to do work.
** Highlights:  In order to track the amount of time that work has not been done, I had to utilise the Timer class provided by Java. Furthermore, I have made many attempts to restructure the code for this feature so as to better adhere to the principles commonly used in coding practices. I have also provided the graphics for the Pet.

* *Major enhancement*: Settings tab + Set Commands
** What it does: The settings tab and the set commands allow the user to customise the app to better suit his/her needs. The user can customise the name of the pet, the duration prefered for the pomodoro cycle and also the goal for the daily challenge.
** Justification: The purpose of the set commands is so the user will be able to modify the features provided in the application to better cater to his/her needs.
** Highlights: In order to create the settings tab, I had to learn JavaFx. To create the set commands, I had to define my own set of classes and also learn Regex so as to determine the validity of certain inputs. Furthermore, I had to augment it on top of the code produced by my teammates (as I was changing the attributes of their code).
