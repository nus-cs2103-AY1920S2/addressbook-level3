== PROJECT: EYLAH

---

== Overview

EYLAH is a desktop application specifically programmed for Freshmen staying on NUS Campus. It aims to ease their lives
at halls/residential colleges by providing them with an application to split bills easily and help
them track their diet. The user interacts with it using a CLI and it is programmed using JAVA 11.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: [In Process]
** What it does:
** Justification:
** Highlights:
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Major Enhancements*:

. *Refactored entire AB3 Code base to be used for EYLAH*
(Refactoring Codebase - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/126[#126]

*** *What it does:* +
The idea was to allow both the Expense Splitter and Diet Tracker features of EYLAH to be built onto the existing AB3
framework rather than replace it entirely.

*** *Justification:* +
The partitioning into the two feature sections during the refactoring meant that it would be easy to extend the app in
the future when adding more new features. It would also allow the two teams for each of the features work independently
without much conflict of code, especially during the initial building phase where there are bound to be many bugs.
Building on the existing AB3 code base also meant that we were able to follow the good practices and structure used.
*** *Highlights:* +
As we had already started development of the two features before the refactoring, the highlight was trying to understand
the existing structure at that point to refactor and partition without introducing any bugs. This required working
together with my teammates to understand the functionality they had started to implement.

*** *Credits:* +
Address Book 3 Code Base

. *Adding of Food, Calories and Date classes, their test classes for the Diet Tracker*
(Food, Calories, Tests - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/104[#104]
& Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/125[#125]
& Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/111[#111])
(Date - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/104[#104])

*** *What it does:* +
Food is used to represent a food item to be added into the diet tracker and it stores a Calorie object that contains the
number of calories in the food.

*** *Justification:* +
These classes are what the Diet Tracker is built upon as almost every command uses the classes to track the
food intake of users. Without these classes, users would be unable to track the food they eat and their
calorie intake. Date was added subsequently to allow for functionality of tracking food by date.

*** *Highlights:* +
The highlight was understanding the requirements of a user when using the Diet Tracker and translating them into the
Food class. For example, for a diet tracker a user would want a food item that they store to have calories so as to
track and a name to remember by. It was also interesting to understand how date was to be stored. Instead of serializing
the LocalDateTime object, I decided to store as a string and call the parser that Java offers to convert it back.

*** *Credits:* +
AB3 Code Base on how Person is being modelled and used. Duke for the idea of using LocalDateTime.


. *Implement Storage for Diet Tracker in EYLAH*
*** *What it does:* +
Store food data of user so that when the app is restarted, the information still exists.
(Storage - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/152[#152]
& https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/210[#210])

*** *Justification:* +
Users will not constantly keep the app open and there are times when they would close it,thus, storage
allows users to close the app and continue where they left off without doing all the work again.
*** Highlights:
It was quite a challenge dealing with the storage due to the complex nature of translating Java objects into a form that
can be stored in a Json. There were several issues, such as data being able to be stored but no read when the app was
re-initialised.
*** Credits: Would like to credit all my team mates in discussing and deciding that in this case the best way to store
would be as a JSON rather than a string and also helping me with troubleshooting storage issues.

. *Implement Add, Delete Commands and relevant tests*
*** *What it does:* +
Allows for food to be added and removed.
(Add, Delete - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/128[#128])
(Tests - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/242[#242])

*** *Justification:* +
The core functionality of a diet tracking app is to be able to control the food in the app, that the Add and Delete
commands let you do.

*** Highlights:
It was intriguing to understand the LogicManager as this was my first implementation of logic components.

*** Credits: Address Book 3


. *Implement various list command (Daily, By Tag, By Time Period, All)*
*** *What it does:* +
This allows the list shown to change based on the flag provided by the user. They can view daily list, filter by tag,
filter by time period or view all consumption ever.
(List Fix - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/210[#210])
(List By Tag - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/221[#221])
(List By Past Num of Days - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/225[#225])
(Refactor Flags For Each Type - https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/248[#248])


*** *Justification:* +
Instead of simply listing out all the food, there are different list commands for different user needs. If the user
wants to track his daily consumption, they can view the daily list, if they wish to find a certain type of food,
they can filter by tag and if they want to know what they ate over a past number of days they can use time period.

*** Highlights:
The incorporation of the various list command types was not straightforward as it did not just require changes in the
List Command but also required addition of date and tags into food to be filtered.

*** Credits: My team mate, Jarrod for the idea on having different types of lists to serve different user functions


* *Minor enhancement*:

.  *Show Total Calories Intake and Calories left based on Mode* +
(Total Calorie Count - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/248[#248])
(Show Remaining Calories - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/365[#356])

*** *What it does:* +
Tabulate the total calorie intake for the day and display to the user. Based on the mode, obtain the calorie limit
and let the user know how many more calories he can take or whether he has hit the limit.

*** *Justification:* +
Knowing how many calories have been taken in and how much more one can eat would let the user better track his diet to
know whether to consume more or less.

.  *Fix Several Failing Tests* +
(Fix Bmi, Mode, Height, Weight Tests - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/375[#375])
(Fix AddCommand, ListCommand, LogicManager Tests - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/247[#247])
(Fix JsonFoodBookStorage Test - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/243[#243])
(Fix Add, Delete, List Test - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/242[#242])

*** *What it does:* +
There were many test methods that were failing.

*** *Justification:* +
The classes would not be able to be rigorously tested if the assertions do not work. This also meant that we potentially
had problems in our code if the test classes were correct.

*** *Highlights* +
It was extremely hard to understand why the tests were failing, thus, required extensive logging and tracing to find out
problems in the code.

.  *Fix Storage Bugs* +
(Storing of height, weight, mode - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/318[#318])
(Reading height, weight from storage - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/362[#362])
(Reading existing JSON - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/210[#210])

*** *What it does:* +
There were many bugs with storage, first when implementing storage for food and subsequently when implementing storage
for personal metrics. For the storing for food, it was being saved to a JSON but could not be loaded when app was
re-initialised. For the storing of personal metrics, there was issue with generating of the JSON file.

*** *Highlights* +
Similar to the bugs with tests, it was quite challenging to figure out my values were not able to be stored or read.

.  *Fix Overflow Bug For Number Of Days* +
(Num of Days Overflow - Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W13-1/main/pull/318[#373])

*** *What it does:* +
There was an issue during internal testing where extremely large values would cause overflow even when the data type
was a long.

*** *Highlights* +
There was much discussion on where to handle this and impose a limit. Here, I imposed a limit in the parser based on
the size of the input string and taking into consideration the average lifespan of a human.

Questions to ask: +
1. Is JSON the most optimal way of storing the data? Would text files have been more appropriate in this instance? +
2. Are there additional attributes that should be in a food?
