== PROJECT: iTrackPro

---

== Overview

iTrack Pro is for the grocery shop owners to keep track of the products, customers, and transactions of the shop and have a better understanding of the business by viewing the performance of products and behaviors of customers.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
1. Added *the ability to manage transcations*, e.g., *addt*, *editt*, *findt*, *listt*, *undot*, *cleart*.
** What it does: It records, edits, lists, finds, deletes transactions from the system. The quantity and sales attribute of products will be affected as well.
** Justification: This feature allows the customer to manage a large amount of transactions. It improves the usability of the application and increases the efficiency for the user to manage inventory system.
** Highlights: Adding/editting/undoing transactions will also update the quantity/sales attributes of related products. A future date time in the future is not allowed.
** Credits: These operations are inspired from the operations of persons in AB3 system.

2. Added the *ability to plot the quantity sold of a product in a certain time range*.
** What it does: The command fetches all transactions related with the specified product in a certain time period, then
converts the data to daily time series format and plot it in a bar chart.
** Justification: This feature allows users to understand the popularity of a product visually in a trend format, such that they
could make decisions of whether to stock up or down the product.
** Highlights: If a time range is not specified, the command will consider the last 7 days by default. An end date before start date or date in the future is not allowed.

3. Added the histogram of products to the statistics panel.
** What is does: It fetches the quantity and sales of all the products and group them by the amount of quantity/sales.
The data is then plot in a line chart format.
** Justification: It allows the user to understand whether the business is healthy, E.g. whether most of the products have sufficient inventory, is there any super-sales-creator or all the products share the same sales evenly.
** Highlights: They are displayed upon the application is launched. The graph will be updated everytime a user takes any action, e.g. adding a new product.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Update the UI from three side-by-side lists to tab panes with transactions representated by rows in a table (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/186[#186]).
** Split the original shared quantity class to TransactionQuantity and ProductQuantity with different minimal values. Merged sales and money class (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/117[#117], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/192[#192]).
** Set default dateTime and money for transactions (Pull request https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/117[#117]).
** Added test for transaction model, logic, and test utils (PR https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/209[#209], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/201[#201], https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103-T09-2/main/pull/197[#197],
