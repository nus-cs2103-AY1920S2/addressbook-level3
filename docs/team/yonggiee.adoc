== PROJECT: FitBiz

== Overview

FitBiz is a desktop fitness business management application. It keeps track of the user's schedule. He can record client's information and the exercises they did with the personal bests automatically generated. Graphical visualisations of his client's progress can also be displayed. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface(CLI), and it has a Graphical User Interface(GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java version 11.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Exercise classes and its commands*
** What it does: allows the user to record their client's exercises. The recorded exercises will then be shown in a table for the user to see. The commands includes:
- `add-e` Command +
Users will be able to add exercises to the exercise table.
- `edit-e` Command +
Users will be able to edit existing exercises.
- `delete-e` Command +
Users will be able to delete existing exercises.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because recording the exercises of clients is one of the main features of the application. Many other features like showing the client's personal bests and drawing their clients' progression graph rely on having the exercises recorded.
** Highlights: Many of the future features will require the exercise classes. Therefore, it is essential to have thorough considerations on how the classes are implemented. I also wrote a substantial amount of code to test the classes while practising good test case designs like boundary value analysis. This will help reduce further bugs when expanding the application.

* *Major enhancement*: hooked many features from Logic to GUI
** What it does: features are shown in GUI instead of being shown in text format.
** Justification: In order for the application to be appealing and user-friendly, the features have to be properly displayed in the GUI. The features include:
- The exercise progession graph +
 This is one of the features that is proposed to really attract users. It is a step further from the user just recording his clients' exercises and having the user see the progression of his clients over a period of time.
- The client's information displayed after `view-c` command +
We have a separate component to show the client's detailed information. This helps to reduce the clients' information displayed in the `ClientCard` in `ClientListPanel`. The user can see the essential details of each client at a glance and only see the detailed information after a `view-c` command.
- The exercise table done by the client +
The user will be able to see the exercises done by their clients' listed in a table instead of being shown text in the `ResultDisplay`. This provides a better user experience.

** Highlights: This enhancement requires a good understanding of Javafx. I have developed a good grasp at using it to provide GUI for Java application.
- The exercise progession graph +
I used `LineChart` from Javafx to display the graph. The X axis to be shown is date but JavaFx only provides `NumberAxis` and `CategoryAxis`. To display the axis as date, I used the `NumberAxis` but also had to use `setTickLabelFormatter()` to change the label from `epochDay` to date.
- The client's information displayed after `view-c` command +
There is a lot of information shown after `view-c` but only a limited space in the GUI. To solve this, I implemented `ScrollPane` so that the user can scroll to view the information.
- The exercise table done by the client +
We decided it is best for the exercises to be viewed in a table form. To do so, I used `TableView` from Javafx.

* *Minor enhancement*: refactored the `Storage` component from AB3 to Fitbiz

* *Minor enhancement*: added `Gender` and `Remarks` attributes to `Client`
