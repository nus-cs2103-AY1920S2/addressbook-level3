== PROJECT: ResuMe


== Overview

*ResuMe* is a desktop application to build and manage resumes. You can create resumes, add items
to resumes, and generate them with a handful of commands. The majority of interactions are via the Command Line Inteface
(CLI).

The project builds upon the code from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/addressbook-level3[Address Book Level 3 (AB3)], a desktop Address Book application.
**ResuMe** retains the characteristics of AB3 while also having its own uniqueness. It is truly remarkable.



This portfolio showcases my skills and contributions.

== 1. Summary of contributions

=== 1.1. *Code contributed*: https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=wardetu&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=wardetu&tabRepo=AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-1%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[Link to my code contribution via RepoSense] +

=== 1.2. Enhancements implemented

* *Major enhancement*:
** Added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
*** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reverted using the redo command.
*** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user tend to make mistakes with commands and the application can provide them a convenient way to rectify
their mistakes.
*** Highlights: the feature provides a huge leap forward in term of quality of life for the user. It also shows improve cohesiveness for our application because the
package of functionality feels complete and resembles an actual in-use product in the market. Many alternatives were looked at and I gained a lot of
insights while searching for the most suitable implementation.
** Planned *data encryption and log-in functionality*
*** Stashed changes that will be polished and released in a later version. They will allow user more security with ResuMe.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Added *sort functionality for items*
*** What it does: allows the user to sort item lists based on different criteria like name or time.
*** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can quickly sort the items with a single command. Well organized list of items make it
easier for user to utilise other commands, especially `redit`.
*** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It is challenging since the functionality is freshly new and no similar implementation exists
in the original AddressBook Level 3.

=== 1.3 Contributions to documentation:
** Updated JavaDoc comments and provided justification where needed.

** Updated the User Guide for the following sections:
*** 1.2. Overview
*** 4.7. Deleting an item: `delete`
*** 4.8. Sorting an item list: `add`
*** 4.12. Undoing a command: `undo`
