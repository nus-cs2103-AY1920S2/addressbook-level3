== PROJECT: Mod Manager



== Overview

*Mod Manager* is a desktop application that assists NUS students
in *managing tasks, schedules, and contacts for their modules in a semester*.
Our team, which consists of five software developers,
took over an existing desktop Java application
https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/addressbook-level3/[Address Book (Level 3)]
with about 6 KLoC and evolve it into our *Mod Manager* with more than 10 KLoC.
The project spans over a period of eight weeks, where each of us
idealise and design the product, utilise CI/CD for weekly project enhancements,
implement features and functionality, write documentation (User Guide & Developer Guide),
and take part in Quality Assurance.

Technologies: Java, JavaFx, GitHub, Intellij IDEA

The following sections document all the contributions that I have made to *Mod Manager*.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*:
I personally contributed almost 4 KLoC to Mod Manager. All my code contributions
can be found https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=dinhnhobao&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-02-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=dinhnhobao&tabRepo=AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-4%2Fmain%5Bmaster%5D[here].

* *Major enhancement*: idealise and design the `Task` component of Mod Manager. The `Task`
component allows NUS students to manage their tasks, such as programming assignments, homework,
tutorials, reviewing lecture content, exam revision for their respective modules in a semester.
Implement most of the commands available for the `Task` component of Mod Manager.

** What it does: every `Task` has a description, a time frame (for example, `13/04/2020 23:59`),
and a `Module` it belongs to. It allows users to organise and manage their tasks easier, with
commands such as CRUD, mark the task as completed, view uncompleted tasks,
view tasks by `Module`, find `Task` by its description, and search for a `Task` by its date,
month, or year.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because every NUS student
has a lot of things to do in the semester, and `Task` management offers a way for them
to plan, and manage their tasks better. The `Task` component blends in well with `Mod Manager`
and its other components, for example, every `Task` is allocated to an academic `Module`
.
** Highlights: The implementation of the project is tedious. It required a great amount of effort to understand the original https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[AddressBook (Level 3)]
code given in order to morph and build upon this original project. Every small increment in the `Task` features require changes to multiple
existing parts of the code, which requires using debugging tools and tracing the code to understand the code execution sequence.
For example, with a small change in the `Task` class design, multiple `JUnit` test cases and data `Storage` design
need to be changed. The `Task` component also has some dependencies on other components, as well as multiple other components
have dependencies on the `Task` component. This requires good communication skills between the team
to notify each other every time the high-level design of `Task` or other components change, even
with just a slight change. The `Task` component also required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives,
which lead to incremental changes over the period of the project. For the commands implemented,
input validation and data formatting is critical to avoid unexpected behaviours to our application.

** Credits: The idea is adapted from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[AddressBook (Level 3)]
and https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S2/duke[the Duke project]. Huge thanks to my teammates who
have gave feedback and improved on the design of the `Task`, which includes making it more OOP
to integrate it better with the rest of the application, and adding the `taskId` feature
to support the identification of tasks in our `Task` commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: design and implement the UI to represent a `Task`. The design is useful for the
value proposition of the product, as it helps you to recognise what tasks are completed and
what are not easily.

Dark red color indicates a task that is not yet done.

Green color indicates a task that is already completed.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management: mainly responsible for managing deadlines and deliverables for our team.
*** Ensure that all milestone progress are reached (which includes team-based and individual-based tasks). We managed to achieve
more than 90% of the recommended milestone tasks, much higher than the minimum requirement
of 60% of the class.
*** Managed releases https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-4/main/releases/tag/v1.2[v1.2]
and https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-4/main/releases/tag/v1.2.1[v1.2.1] on GitHub
*** Maintained the issue tracker and milestones for team repo

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Design and update the UI color scheme for a `Task` (PR https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-4/main/pull/128/commits/96669def1decbbc8043c7e7db97d4ba775ddfd0d[#128])
*** Wrote extensive tests for `Task` component, maintaining test coverage of around 90% for my components as shown
https://coveralls.io/builds/30020995/source?filename=file%3A%2Fhome%2Ftravis%2Fbuild%2FAY1920S2-CS2103T-F10-4%2Fmain%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fseedu%2Faddress%2Flogic%2Fcommands%2Ftask%2FTaskMarkAsDoneCommand.java[here] and

== Contributions to the User Guide
|===
|_Given below are some sections I contributed to the User Guide.
They comprise some of the commands for the `Task` component.
They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===
NOTE: For your easier understanding of the content below, every `Task` in a `Module` has an `ID`,
which uniquely identifies the task in the module. The `ID` is important for us to differentiate a task
from the others in the `Module`, since two `Task` s may have the same description and time frame.
The `Task` component uses Singapore's standard date format (`dd/MM/yyyy`).
