== Introduction

NUSProductivity is an application designed to let you better manage your school work. The app is set out to enhance your productivity in school through 5 main features, module planning, CAP (cumulative average point) tracking, note taking, deadline and task listing, and finally, diary logging. This app is designed mainly for NUS students with the possibility to customise it for students from other universities in the future. More importantly, NUSProductivity is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
