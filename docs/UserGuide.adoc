== Introduction

FitHelper (FH) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing daily diet and exercises*. More importantly, FH is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FH can get your weight management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

FitHelper mainly serves as a fitness log book where users can *mark down their diet and exercises entries* and *be reminded about their plans*. They can also *visualize their performance* to be encouraged.


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `FitHelper.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Helper.
Please ensure that writing or reading data inside the home folder that you choose
does **not** require administrator permission.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. (For Mac, the window size can be enlarged but the zoomed out window version is not functioning currently. So, window size should be kept. For Windows, the window size cannot be changed.)
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all logs
* **`add`**`x/s n/swimming t/Wednesday 18:00 l/utown gym c/500` : adds an entry named `swimming` to the dashboard page.
* **`delete`**`i/3 x/f` : deletes the 3rd entry from food entry list shown in the dashboard
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

// tag::command_format[]
====
*General rules about command format*

* A prefix followed by a word in `UPPER_CASE` form a parameter to be supplied by the user.

Example: in `add n/NAME`, `n/NAME` is a parameter which can be `n/running`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]`
means both `n/swimming r/fun` and `n/swimming` are both valid user inputs.
* Parameters not in square brackets are compulsory e.g. `x/TYPE k/KEYWORDS`
means you must input both `TYPE` and `KEYWORDS` parameters.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[r/remark]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `r/really fun`, `r/really fun r/helps me lose weight` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if a command format is `add n/NAME t/TIME`, then
 `add n/Bob t/2020-04-10-08:00` and `add t/2020-04-10-18:00 n/Bob` are both acceptable.
* The field `TYPE` in this document refers to type of entries.
The only valid values are food OR sports, or in acronym f OR s.
* The field `TIME` needs to be in the format of yyyyy-mm-dd-hh:MM, e.g. `2020-04-10-03:00`
* The field `DATE` should be entered in the format of `yyyy-mm-dd`, e.g. `2020-02-02`.
* Our time parser will auto-correct some invalid date/time entered. More specifically,
as long as the month value is valid and the day value is between 1 and 31,
the parser will auto-correct an invalid date to the last valid date of the year-month
specified by the user.

Example: `2020-02-31-12:34` will be auto-corrected as `2020-02-29-12:34` since
`2020-02-29` is the last valid date of Feb 2020.  `2020-22-31` and `2020-02-40`
will not be auto-corrected since the month value is invalid or the day value is beyond 31.

* The field `INDEX` should be a positive integer representing a one-based index of an entry in an list.
* The field `DURATION` should be a positive double number,
representing duration in hours. e.g. `dr/1.5` for 1.5 hours.
* You may input multiple parameters of a same prefix, but only the last input value will be read.

Example: `add n/Alice n/Bob n/Charlie` is equivalent to `add c/Charlie`.

* Please do not input parameters not required by a particular command.

Example: the format of sort command is `sort [x/TYPE] by/SORT_BY [o/ORDER]`,
so you should not input other parameters like `n/NAME`, `k/KEYWORDS` or `v/VALUE`.

* The flag `-f` should be added *just after the command word*, e.g. `update -f`.
====
//end::command_format[]

//tag::help[]
=== Viewing help : `help`

Asks the application to go to Help page, which displays a condensed list of available
functions with correct format of input. A link to the User Guide
is also provided after the list. The user can also go to the Help page by
clicking the **Help** button on the left hand side of the application.
Note that once the user types `help` or click the **Help** button,
the url of the User Guide is copied to the clipboard, so the user
can directly access the Guide by pasting the url into the browser.

Format: `help`

.Help page

//end::help[]

=== Keep Food and Sports Entries

//tag::add[]
==== Go to dashboard page: `home`

Go to the Dashboard page, which displays three entry lists:
Food Entry History, Sports Entry History and Reminders.

* *Food Entry History* +
Shows food entries.

* *Sports Entry History* +
Shows sports entries.

* *Reminders* +
Shows entries that are remarked as not done.

Note that you can also go to the Dashboard page by clicking the `DashBoard` button on the
left side of the application. However, using `home` command will further **reset the display status**
of the Dashboard page to the default setting (showing all entries in all three lists).

Example: +
If you input `reminder` command, the DashBoard page will now only show entries in the reminders
list (display status changed). If you switch to other page and then try to go back to the Dashboard
page by clicking the `DashBoard` button, the Dashboard page will still only show the reminders
list. But is you input `home` command, entries in all three lists will be shown.

==== Adding an entry: `add`

Adds an entry to the fitness log book. The entry added will be displayed in DashBoard, Calendar
and possibly Today Page (if its date is today) immediately after the command is executed. +
Note that due to space constraint, entry card in DashBoard and Today page will only display
first 14 characters of its name and first 21 characters of its location. The entry icon in
Calendar Page are even more constrained.

* FitHelper accepts duplicate fields, but only the last value specified under this field will be taken.*

* Default value for unspecified optional field: `status` : Undone; `duration`: 1 hr*

Format: `add x/TYPE n/NAME t/DATETIME l/LOCATION c/CALORIE [dr/DURATION]...`

Examples:

* `add x/s n/running t/2020-04-10-18:00 l/utown gym c/500`
* `add x/f n/chicken rice t/2020-04-10-11:00 l/Super Snacks c/200`

Format: `list`
//end::list[]

//tag::reminder[]
==== View Reminder : `reminder`

Shows a list of all undone tasks on the specified date on the home page (Dashboard). +
Format: `reminder [d/DATE]` +
If no `DATE` is specified, FitHelper displays all undone entries.

Examples:

* `reminder d/2020-03-31` +
Switches to Home Page and shows all undone entries on `2020-03-31` in the reminder field.

//end::reminder[]

//tag::edit[]
==== Editing an entry : `edit`

Edits an existing entry in the fitness log book with the specified values. +
Format: `edit x/TYPE i/INDEX [s/STATUS] [n/NAME] [t/TIME] [l/LOCATION] [c/CALORIE][dr/DURATION]...` +

****
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* If the user is currently in other pages, a successful execution of `edit` will switch the page to the dashboard.
* To obtain accurate indices, the user should first switch to the home page by calling `home` or `list` and refer to the displayed list in `food entry history` and `sport entry history` fields.
* Additionally, the user can first called `find` command and then refer to the resulting list's indices to `edit` an entry. However, right after a `find`, the user can only refer to entries that are currently displayed. +
i.e. If there are 5 food entries in total, and after `find` 2 food entries are displayed. If the user does not switch back to the home page, he can only refer to the displayed 2 entries (with indices 1 and 2). He can `edit` any entries only when he turns to home page after the `find`.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:
(after switching to Home Page)
* `edit x/s i/1 t/2020-04-05-16:00 l/PGP gym` +
Edits the time and email location of the 1st entry to be `Friday 4pm` and `PGP gym` respectively.

===== Mark an entry as done

Users can mark an entry as done, either a meal or sports, where the calories intake and consumption will be taken in to consideration.
Format: `edit x/TYPE i/INDEX s/Done`

===== Mark an entry as undone

Similar to the previous command, marking an entry as undone edits the `s/` field and modify it as `Undone`.
Format: `edit x/TYPE i/INDEX s/Undone`

// tag::find[]
==== Locating entries by name: `find`

Finds entries whose names contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find [x/TYPE] k/ONE_OR_MORE_KEYWORDS`
If the `TYPE` field is empty, FitHelper will search from the whole list.

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `apples` will match `Apples`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Apple Pie` will match `Pie Apple`.
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Straw` will not match `Strawberries`.
* Entries matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Apple Banana` will return `Apple Pie`, `Banana Milkshake`.
****

Examples:

* `find x/s k/running` +
Returns `running` and `slow running`
* `find x/food k/Juice Apple` +
Returns any entry having names `Juice`,  or `Apple`
//end::find[]

//tag::delete[]
==== Deleting an entry : `delete`

Deletes the entry at the specified `INDEX` from the fitness log book. +
Format: `delete x/TYPE i/INDEX`
****
* To obtain accurate indices, the user should first switch to the home page by calling `home` or `list` and refer to the displayed list in `food entry history` and `sport entry history` fields.
* Additionally, the user can first called a `find` and then refer to the resulting list's indices to `delete` an entry. However, right after a `find`, the user can only refer to entries that are currently displayed. +
i.e. If there are 5 food entries in total, and after `find` 2 food entries are displayed. If the user does not switch back to the home page, he can only refer to the displayed 2 entries (with indices 1 and 2).
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `delete x/sports index/2`
Deletes the 2nd sports entry in the sports list from dashboard.
//end::delete[]

.Delete Command

//tag::sort[]
==== Sort food/sports entry list: `sort`

Sorts food or sports entry list, or both of them, based on starting time or
calorie value or name of the entry (case insensitive), in either ascending or descending order.
In addition, the reminders entry list will also be sorted in the same manner specified by the user.
The user must specify the sorting criterion `cal/c OR time/t OR name/n`.
If the user does not specify the type of entry list, both lists will be sorted.
And if the user does not specify the sorting order `a OR d`,
the default order is descending (i.e. entry that starts later
or entry with higher calorie value or entry whose name starts with
later alphabet comes first).

format: `sort [x/TYPE] by/SORT_BY [o/ORDER]`

Examples:

* `sort x/f by/time o/a` (sort food entry list and reminders list in ascending order of recording time,
i.e. the older entry comes first)
* `sort by/c` (sort both food and sports entry list, as well as reminders list,
in descending order of calorie value, i.e. entry with higher calorie intake/consumption comes first)

.Dashboard page after all 3 lists are sorted by time in descending order (later entry comes at top)
image::Sort.png[width="790"]

//end::sort[]

//tag::check[]
==== Check calorie intake/consumption of common food/sports: `check`

Searches through the pre-set database for calorie intake/consumption information
about common food/sports (i.e. a datum) whose name matches/contains keywords specified by the user.
Note that due to space constraint, at most 3 matching data will be shown
at the left-bottom corner of the application. Each datum shows the name of
the food/sports and its calorie intake/consumption information: for food, it will be
in cal per serving (weight per serving in gram will also be shown); for sports, it will
be in cal per hour for a 70kg person.
Please note after the command is executed, the application will
automatically go to Dashboard page *without resetting the display status*.

The searching works as follows:

* Retrieves food/sports data based on check type specified by the user.
* Checks and adds food/sports datum whose name **equals one of the keywords**.
If fewer than 3 food/sports data are added so far, checks and adds food/sports datum
whose name **contains the keywords as a whole**.
If still fewer than 3 food/sports data are added so far, checks and adds food/sports datum
whose name **contains one of the keywords**.
* If no datum is added after all the steps, replies user that search failed.
Otherwise, shows user the data.

format: `check x/TYPE k/ONE_OR_MORE_KEYWORDS`

Examples:

* `check x/food k/apple` (searches for calorie intake of food
whose name match/contain keyword "apple")

.Check command result (matching data found)

//image::Check2.png[width="790"]
//tag::diary[]
=== Keep Diaries

The user can keep a diary in FitHelper, and command for adding/editing/deleting/searching/clearing diary logs.

* `diary` switches to the `Diary Page` where all diary logs are displayed in chronological order
//end::diary[]

//tag::addDiary[]
==== Add a new diary: `addDiary`

* `addDiary d/DATE dc/DIARYCONTENT` +
adds a new diary on the specified `DATE` with the specified `CONTENT` +

If there is previously added diary on the specified `DATE`, calling `addDiary` will rewrite the content.

Examples:

* `addDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/Happy birthday Alice!`
Adds a diary log on the date `2020-03-31` with the content `Happy birthday Alice!`.
//end::addDiary[]

//tag::appendDiary[]
==== Append new content to an existing diary: `appendDiary`
* `appendDiary d/DATE dc/APPENDED CONTENT` +
appends new content to the existing diary on the specified `DATE`. +

If the specified `DATE` does not have previously added diary log, this command will be discarded with a `DIARY_NOT_FOUND`
reminder.

Examples:

* `appendDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/You are one year older now:)` (after `addDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/Happy birthday Alice!`)+
This command appends the new diary content to the existing the diary log on the date `2020-03-31`.
The new diary content after this command will be "Happy birthday Alice! You are one year older now:)".
//end::appendDiary[]

//tag::editDiary[]
==== Edit a diary: `editDiary`
* `editDiary d/DATE dc/NEW DIARYCONTENT` +
edits the diary on the specified `DATE` with the new `DIARYCONTENT`. +

If the specified `DATE` does not have previously added diary log, this command will be discarded with a `DIARY_NOT_FOUND`
reminder.
If the existing diary with the specified `DATE` has the same content as the specified content, this command will be discarded with a `DUPLICATE_DIARY`
reminder.

Examples:

* `editDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/Happy birthday Alice!` +
This command edits the content of the diary log on the date `2020-03-31` with the content `Happy birthday Alice!`.
//edn::editDiary[]

//tag::findDiary[]
==== Find a diary: `findDiary`
* `findDiary [d/DATE] [k/ONE OR MORE KEYWORDS]` +
finds diaries either on the specified `DATE` or contains the specified `KEYWORDS`. +
Both `DATE` and `KEYWORDS` fields are optional. If neither appear, FitHelper will display all diaries. +
If there is no diary under the specified `DATE`, this command will be discarded with the reminder of
`DIARY_NOT_FOUND`.

****
* The field `DATE` has higher priority than `KEYWORDS` in the search.
i.e. If the `DATE` field is non-empty, regardless of the presence and the content of the `KEYWORDS` field,
the diary under that date will be displayed. If the specified `DATE` contains no previous diary logs,
no diary will be listed.
* If the field `DATE` is left empty, only the `KEYWORDS` field is considered in the search,
similar to the case of `find` command for food/sport entries.
* The keyword searching rules are the same as in `Section 4.2.5 Locating entries by name : *find*`.
****

Examples:

* `findDiary k/running` +
Displays diaries with their content containing the keyword `running`, ignoring the letter capitalization.
* `find d/2020-03-31 k/cake` +
Returns the diary on the date of `2020-03-31` regardless of the `KEYWORDS` field.
//end::findDiary[]

//tag::deleteDiary[]
==== Delete a diary: `deleteDiary`
* `deleteDiary d/DATE` +
deletes the diary on the specified `DATE`. +

If there is no diary under the specified `DATE`, this command will be discarded with the reminder of
`DIARY_NOT_FOUND`.

Examples:

* `deleteDiary d/2020-03-31` +
This command deletes the diary log on the date `2020-03-3`, if the diary on this date exists, and discards the command
if no diary was added previously on this date.
//end::deleteDiary[]

//tag::clearDiary[]
==== Clear the diary: `clearDairy`

* `clearDiary`＋
clears all diary logs in this FitHelper.
[TIP]
The user can always revoke the clearing command by calling `undo`, which will be explained in a later section.
//end::clearDiary[]

// tag::clear[]

=== Keep Weight Records

==== Weight Page: `weight`

Weight page serves to be a summary for user's weight and BMI changes according to time. +
It shows user data in graph for easy understanding. By default, it will generate graph from all history data chronologically.

* *Gap notification* +
The top notification shows the comparison between user current weight and target weight. +
- If current weight is *larger* than target, the gap between the two will be highlighted.
- If current weight is *the same or less* than the target, a succeed notification will be generated.

* *Trend Graph - Weight* +
Display a trend graph of user's weight according to time.

* *Trend Graph - BMI* +
Display a trend graph of user's BMI according to time. The BMI value is calculated by weight and height value at that date.

Format: `weight`

==== Add Weight Records : `addWeight`

Add a new weight record into the weight records database. A weight record is related to date and weight value, and a auto-computed BMI value will be stored as well. +
Every `addWeight` command will lead to the weight page.
If a new weight record is added successfully, two new points will be added into the two trend graphs separately. +

Format: `addWeight v/WEIGHT_VALUE [d/DATE]`

****
* If no weight record exists in the database, "Not Available Now" will be shown in Profile Page's Current Weight and Current BMI fields.
* The date of a new weight record can be *omitted* when user inputs the `addWeight` command. By default, it will refer to the date of today.
* The date should be in format of `yyyy-MM-dd`, and should *not after the date of today*.
* *No two weight records should have the same date.* If adding a new weight record with the same date as an existing weight,
a warning will be generated, and thus will fail to add.
****

Examples:

* `addWeight v/50.0 d/2020-02-01`
* `addWeight v/52.30`

==== Edit Weight Records : `editWeight`

Edit an existing weight record in the weight records database.
A weight record is identified by its *unique date*, and user can find the date on the x-axis of the Weight Trend Graph. +
User are able to edit the weight value, and corresponding BMI value will be auto-computed using the new weight value and user's *current height*. +
Every `editWeight` command will lead to the weight page.
If a weight record is edited successfully, two new points will change their positions on the two trend graphs separately. +

Format: `editWeight [d/DATE] v/NEW_WEIGHT_VALUE`

****
* The date should be in format of `yyyy-MM-dd`. If no existing weight record is on the input date, the input date is considered as invalid, and thus a warning will be thrown.
* If the date is *omitted* when user inputs the `editWeight` command, by default, it will refer to the date of today.
* If the edited weight record is the *latest weight record* in the database, an update in Profile Page's Current Weight and Current BMI fields can be found as well.
* If the new weight value is the same as original weight value in the weight records, an exception will be thrown.
****

Examples:

* `editWeight d/2020-02-01 v/51.0`
* `editWeight v/52.40`

==== Delete Weight Records : `deleteWeight`

Delete an existing weight record in the weight records database.
Same as `editWeight` command, a weight record is identified by its *unique date*, and user can find the date on the x-axis of the Weight Trend Graph. +
Every `deleteWeight` command will lead to the weight page.
If a weight record is deleted successfully, two corresponding points will be removed from the two trend graphs separately. +

Format: `deleteWeight [d/DATE]`

****
* The date should be in format of `yyyy-MM-dd`. If no existing weight record is on the input date, the input date is considered as invalid, and thus a warning will be thrown.
* If the date is *omitted* when user inputs the `deleteWeight` command, by default, it will refer to the date of today.
* If the deleted weight record is the *latest weight record* in the database, the second latest weight record will be used to update Profile Page's Current Weight and Current BMI fields.
****

Examples:

* `deleteWeight d/2020-02-01`
* `deleteWeight`

==== Clear Weight Records : `clearWeight`

Clear all weight records in the weight records database. +
Weight Page's graphs will be empty, and
Profile Page's Current Weight and Current BMI fields will be `Not Available Now` after clear all weight records.
