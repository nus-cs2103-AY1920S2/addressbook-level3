=== Command Format

(Contributed by Fatin and Gabriel)

This section shows you how all the commands in this guide have been formatted.

[width="%",cols="<20%a,<30%a,<50a",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Format | Meaning | Example

|
`lower_case/`

Any lower case letters, followed by a forward slash
|
These are *prefixes*.

They are used to separate the different parameters of a command.
|
These are prefixes: +
`n/`, `d/`, `t/`

Note that prefixes *cannot have spaces*: +
`n /` is *not a prefix*, and will not be recognized.

|
`UPPER_CASE`

Words in upper case
|
These are *parameters*.

You will need to supply parameters in order to complete certain commands.
|
You can create a *student* with the name *John Doe* using the `student add` command.

Suppose the `student add` command looks like this: +
`student add n/NAME`

Simply replace `NAME` with `John Doe` to create the student *John Doe*: +
`student add n/John Doe`

|
`[UPPER_CASE]`

Words in upper case, surrounded by square brackets
|
These are *optional parameters*.

Certain commands can be used without these parameters.
|
Suppose a command contains *two parameters* next to each other: +
`n/NAME [t/TAG]`

The *first parameter* `NAME` is *compulsory*. +
The *second parameter* `TAG` is *optional*.

Since a `TAG` is *optional*, you will be able to use the command with these *inputs*:

* `n/John Doe t/Fast learner`, or
* `n/John Doe`

|
`UPPER_CASE...`

`[UPPER_CASE]...`

An ellipsis `...` following any words in upper case
|
These are parameters that can be used *multiple times* or *none at all*.
|
The following parameter can be used *multiple times*: +
`t/TAG...`

This means that it can be:

* *Left empty* (i.e. 0 times): +
`t/`
* *Used one time* (i.e. 1 time): +
`t/friend`
* *Used multiple times* (i.e. 2 or more times): +
`t/friend t/family`

//end::commonparameters[]
//tag::duplicateparameters[]

==== Duplicate Parameters

You can specify the same parameter *more than once* in a command.
Depending on the command, you will see *different outcomes*.

Here is a table explaining the different outcomes:

[width="%",cols="<20%a,<30%a,<50a",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|
Parameter
|
Explanation
|
Example

|
Can be used multiple times
|
*All occurrences* will be used when executing the command
|
In the `student add` command, you can create a *student* with *multiple tags*.

Therefore, you can input multiple tags by chaining them: +
`t/needs help t/aka henry`

This will give a student the tags `needs help` and `aka henry`.

|
Can only be used once
|
The very *last occurrence* will be used when executing the command
|
`module add m/CS2103T n/SE n/Software Engineering`

If you execute this command, you will create a *module* with the name `Software Engineering`.

The name `SE` will be ignored.

|=======================================================================
//end::duplicateparameters[]
//tag::rearrangingparameters[]

==== Rearranging Parameters

Parameters can be in *any order* if they have *prefixes*.

For example, if a command needs a `n/NAME` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, you can specify them in any order:

* `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, or
* `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`

However, if the command has a parameter *without a prefix*, that parameter *must* be
the very *first parameter*.

For example, if a command needs an `INDEX`, it must be the *first parameter*:

* `INDEX n/NAME` is valid, but
* `n/NAME INDEX` is invalid
//end::rearrangingparameters[]
//tag::layout[]

[[Layout]]
== Layout

(Contributed by Fatin)

This section gives you a brief overview of the layout of the *TA-Tracker*.

*TA-Tracker* is divided into three `tabs` representing the different *Views*:

* The *Student View* under the `student tab`,
* The *Session View* under the `session tab`, and
* The *Claims View* under the `claims tab`

When you switch to a `tab`, that `tab` will be highlighted in orange.

Furthermore, when you enter a new command, you will be automatically switched to the relevant `tab`
so that you can instantly see the result of the command.

[NOTE]
====
* You can *select* a `tab` to show a different *View*.
This `tab` will be highlighted in *blue*.

* If you are *switched* to a `tab` when you *enter a command*,
that `tab` will be highlighted in *orange*. +
+
This should help you easily remember
where you last made a change in *TA-Tracker*.

* You will sometimes see the `tabs` highlighted in both *orange* and *blue*. +
+
The *orange* `tab` will remain highlighted even if you select another `tab`.

* You may notice that the *orange* and *blue* highlights for the `tabs` are *not
the same size*. +
+
This is to *prevent* the highlights from *overlapping* each other,
allowing you to see them better.

image::Tabs.png[width="790"]
This shows what happens when you last made a change in the `student tab`
and then clicked on the `claims tab`.
====
//end::layout[]
//tag::studentview[]

=== Student View
Under the `student tab`, the *Student View* is used to show you the students that you're teaching. The students
have been grouped according to the *module* and *group* they belong to. The *Student View* has been divided into
three columns.

. The first column shows you a *list of all the modules* that you are a teaching
assistant for.

. The second column shows you a *list of all groups* that you're a teaching assistant
for *in a module of your choice*.
If you haven't chosen anything, you will be shown the groups of the module
in the *first index* in the list of modules by default.

. The third column shows you a *list of all students* in the *group of your choice*. If you
haven't chosen anything, you will be shown the students of the group in the
*first index* in the list of groups by default.

The purpose of the *Student View* is to help you keep track a of your students. It will
show you information such as:


* `NAME`: student name
* `MATRIC_NUMBER`: matriculation number
* `RATING`: ratings you have given the student, represented by stars (on a scale from 1 - 5)
* `EMAIL` and `PHONE`: contact details
* `TAG`: any additional information you have about the student

[NOTE]
====
The `RATING` value must be a positive integer.

that you haven't done yet.

The sessions are automatically sorted by date.

The purpose of the *Session View* is to help you keep track a of your upcoming teaching.
duties. It will show you information such as:

* `SESSION_TYPE`: the type of session
* `DATE`: the date that the session will occur on
* `START` and `END`: the start time and end time of the session

=== Claims View

(Contributed by Fatin)

Under the `claims tab`, the *Claims View* contains a list of all the claimable teaching
duties you have completed so far.

The purpose of this view is to allow a you to keep track of all your claims so
you can easily enter it into the TSS claims form at the end of the semester.

The *Claims View* has been
divided into two columns.

//end::list[]

=== Student View

This section explains all the commands you can use in the *Student View*.

//tag::addmodule[]
[[AddModule]]
==== Adding a Module : `module add`

You can use this command to add a new module to the TA-Tracker.

When a new module is created, the *Student View* will show the groups
and students of the new module. (Initially, a new module doesn't have any students or
groups till you add some).
If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `module add m/MOD_CODE n/NAME`

[NOTE]
====
* You *can't* have two modules with the *same module code* in the TA-Tracker.

* `MOD_CODE` and `MOD_NAME` can't be an empty string or a sequence of spaces.

* You can give a module your own *custom* `MOD_CODE` or `NAME` if you find it easier
to remember. However,  we recommend you use the *official
module code and name* for it.

* If the module name or module code are very long, you can *increase the width* of
the module name list by dragging the edge with your cursor. However, we suggest not
giving the modules long codes or long names. The standard official names are usually
of a good length.

====

[TIP]
====
* You can't edit the `MOD_CODE` once the module has been created, so do take
care to ensure that the code is correct.
====

====
Examples:

* `module add m/CS2100 n/Computer Organisation`
+

image::ModuleAdd.png[,1000]
This will add a module with the module code `CS2100` and name `Computer Organisation`
to the TA-Tracker.

====

[[DeleteModule]]
==== Deleting a Module : `module delete`

You can use this command to delete a module from the TA-Tracker.

When you delete a module, all groups, students and sessions associated with
the module will also be deleted.

When a module is deleted, the *Student View* will go back to its default
setting. That is, you will see the details of the first group in the first module of
the TA-Tracker.
If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `module delete m/MOD_CODE`

[NOTE]
====
* You cannot delete a module that doesn't exist.
====

====
Examples:

* `module delete m/CS2103T`

==== Editing a Module : `module edit`

You can use this command to edit a module's name in the TA-Tracker.

When a module is edited, the *Student View* will show the groups of the edited module and
the students of the first group of the edited module. If you were on a different `tab`,
you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `module edit m/MOD_CODE n/NEW NAME`

[NOTE]
====
* You can only use this command to change the name of the module. The module
code can't be changed.

* Editing a module doesn't affect the students and
groups inside the module.

* MOD_NAME can't be an empty string or a sequence of spaces.

* You cannot edit a module that doesn't exist.

[[EditGroup]]
==== Editing a Group : `group edit`

You can use this command to edit a group in the TA-Tracker.

This command can be used to change the group code and the group type of the group.
The students inside the group will remain intact.

When a group is edited, the *Student View* will show the groups in the module that
the edited group belongs to, as well as the students that belong to the edited group.
If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `group edit g/GROUP_CODE m/MOD_CODE [ng/NEW_GROUP_CODE] [nt/NEW_GROUP_TYPE]`

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* `MOD_CODE` here refers to the module code of the module that contains the group that
you want to edit.

* You can't edit a group inside a module that doesn't exist.

* You can't edit a group that doesn't exist.

* If you are changing the group code, the module shouldn't contain a group that has the
same group code as the new group code.

* While the `nt/` and `ng/` prefixes are optional, at least one of them must be mentioned.
====

====
Examples:

* `group edit g/G01 m/CS3243 nt/lab`
+
image::GroupEdit.png[,900]
This will change the group type of the group with group code `G01`, inside the module with

=== Session View
(Contributed by Chua Yi Jing)

This section explains the different commands that can be used in the *Session View*.

//tag::addsession[]
[[AddSession]]
==== Adding a Session : `session add`

You can use this command to add a new session.

The new session will be shown in the *Session View*, and will automatically
be marked as `not done`.

If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `session tab`.

Format: `session add m/MOD_CODE [s/START] [e/END] [d/DATE] [w/WEEKS] [t/SESSION_TYPE] [n/NOTES]`


[TIP]
====
. If you want to create a session with the current date, start time and end time,
you can omit `s/START` , `e/END` and `d/DATE`.

. You can edit the end time `e/END` and other details later by using the `session edit`
command (details given below in 5.3.3.).

. If the session has a recurring period `[w/WEEKS]`, a new session with the updated date
and timing will be added to *Session View* when it is marked as done.

. You will find the recurring period `[w/WEEKS]` field handy for tasks that happen once every few weeks
such as your weekly lab sessions or fortnightly assignment grading.

====

====
Examples:

* `session add m/CS3243 s/14:00 e/16:00 d/2020-06-20 w/2 t/consultation n/with Alice and Bob`

==== Marking a Session as Done : `session done`

(Contributed by Fatin, Chua Yi Jing)

You can use this command to mark a session as done.

The session marked as done will be removed from the *Session View* and
will automatically appear as a new claim in the *Claims View*.
If the session marked done has a recurring period, a new session with the updated date
and timing will be added to *Session View*.

If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `claims tab`.

Format: `session done INDEX`

==== Filter : `session filter`

(Contributed by Chua Yi Jing)

You can use this command to filter the sessions in the *Session View*.

You can filter the sessions in the following ways:

* `MOD_CODE` - filtering by module code will show you only the sessions affiliated
with that module.

* `SESSION_TYPE` - filtering by session type will show you only the sessions with the specified type

* `DATE` - filtering by a date will show you only the sessions on that date.

The keyword is case-insensitive.

When you execute a new filter command, any previous filters applied on the sessions will
be removed and only the filters from the latest command will be applied on the sessions
list. The filters that are currently being applied are shown at the top of the *Session View*

If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `session tab`.

Format: `session filter [m/MOD_CODE] [t/SESSION_TYPE] [d/DATE]`

====
Example:

* `session filter m/CS3243`
+
image::SessionFilter.png[width="790"]
All sessions in the *Session View* with module code `CS3243` are displayed.

* `session filter m/CS3243 t/tutorial`
+
All sessions in the *Session View* with module code `CS2103T`,
*or* session type `Tutorial` will be shown.

* `session filter m/CS3243`
+
image::SessionFilterMultiple.png[width="790"]
All sessions in the *Session View* with module code  `CS2103T`
will be shown.

(Contributed by Fatin)

Sets the hourly rate for the total income and claim computation.

Format: `setrate RATE`

[NOTE]
====
* If you don't specify a rate, it is set at $40 by default (the rate at which most SOC TAs are being paid per hour).
* `RATE` is the amount you want to change the hourly rate to, this value will be used to calulate the
`Total Earnings` label in the `Claims Tab` as well as the `Statistics Window`.
* The `RATE` must be a positive integer.

You can use this command to generate a report to display information such as:

* A breakdown and summary of completed sessions
* The number of hours of each type of completed sessions
* A breakdown of your student's ratings

Optionally, you can specify a module code. If a module code is specified, the report generated will only include data from the specified module.

Pressing the `esc` key on your keyboard will close the statistics window.

Format: `report [MOD_CODE]`

[NOTE]
====
* Similar to the *Claims View*, the report will only display sessions that have been marked as done.
