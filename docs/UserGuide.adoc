== Introduction
ZeroToOne is an application for managing your exercise regimes. It allows you to transform from a round ‘0’ shape, to a fitter and healthier ‘1’ shape!

ZeroToOne is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their exercise and fitness regimes*. More importantly, ZeroToOne is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ZeroToOne can get your exercise management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested in the magnificent transformation from 0 to 1? Jump to Section 2, <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
