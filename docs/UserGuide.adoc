== Introduction

StudyBuddy is for an application designed for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing module related tasks*.
More importantly, StudyBuddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Study Buddy can get your module management done faster than traditional GUI apps.
