[[Features]]
== Features
The following 11 sections provides you a deeper understanding on how to use the features you can perform in *MODdy* and how the features work.

====
*Command Format*

* Alphabets preceding the `/` sign are the prefix tags you need to provide.
* Words succeeding the `/` sign are the parameters supplied by you, e.g. in `add m/moduleCode`, `moduleCode` is a parameter given by you.
* Parameters can be entered in any format and are case-insensitive, unless stated otherwise.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `m/moduleCode [g/grade]` can be used as `m/CS2103 g/A+` or as `m/CS2103`.
====

// tag::help[]
[[Help]]
=== Viewing help : `help`

If you are unsure about the commands and want to seek help, this command opens up a pop-up help window where there are examples for basic command formats.
For more detailed help, you can visit the link provided in the window, as shown in Figure 3 below. The link directs you to this User Guide where you can get more information on how to use each feature in *MODdy*. +

Format: `help`

image::Help.png[width="790"]
// end::help[]

// tag::new[]
[[New]]
=== Creating new user profile : `new`

If you want to get started on using *MODdy*, you will have to create a new profile. By using this command, it creates a profile for you as shown in the figure below. You will have to provide your details as parameters.

Format: `new n/name c/course y/year.semester [f/focusArea]`

****
* `c/course` and `f/focusArea` is case-insensitive but has to be its *full name*. If you are unsure of what is allowed, you can refer to the <<Appendix, Appendix>> for the list of courses and focus areas supported by *MODdy*.
* If you have yet to decide on a focus area, you can choose to add it to your profile later using the edit feature mentioned in <<Edit, Section 4.4>>. Other profile fields can be changed using the edit feature as well.
* `y/year.semester` must be entered as an integer. You should only enter the year and semester that you are *currently* in. If you are now a Year 2 Semester 1 student, enter `y/2.1`.
* You can only have one profile! If you wish to create a new profile, you can remove it with the delete feature mentioned in <<Delete, Section 4.6>>.
****

Example: `new n/John c/Computer Science y/2.2` creates a new profile with the name "John", currently majoring in "Computer Science" and is a Year 2 Semester 2 student, as shown in Figure 4 below.

.New profile created is displayed in the Profile Panel
image::New.png[width="760"]

TIP: `new n/John c/Computer Science y/2.2 f/Software Engineering` +
If you know your focus area, using this command will add focus area "Software Engineering" to your new profile alongside other details.
// end::new[]


// tag::add[]
[[Add]]
=== Adding module or task: `add`

If you want to add modules to each of your semesters or add tasks to each of your modules in the current semester, this command is the right one for you!

There are *two* ways you can use the `add` command: +

==== Adding a module to *MODdy* +
Format: `add m/moduleCode y/year.semester [g/grade]` +

TIP: You can add multiple modules at the same time but only to the *same* year and semester. +
To add multiple modules, just append the `m/moduleCode` tags right after another, e.g. `add m/CS1231 m/IS1130 m/MA1521 y/1.1`.

NOTE: However, you cannot add grades when adding multiple modules.

****
* `y/year.semester` must be entered as an integer. You should enter the year and semester that you *took the module* in. If you took the module in Year 2 Semester 1, enter `y/2.1`.
* As you have already specified the current semester you are currently in when creating your profile, *MODdy* will indicate modules added to prior semesters, current semester and future semesters as *"COMPLETED"*, *"IN_PROGRESS"* and *"PLANNING"* respectively.
* `g/grade` is optional. If you have yet to obtain a grade for the module, don't worry, you can always add it to the module later using the edit feature mentioned in <<Edit, Section 4.4>>.
****

Example: `add m/CS2103T y/2.2` adds CS2103T to Year 2 Semester 2, as shown in Figure 5 below.

.CS2103T is added as a module under Year 2 Semester 2
image::AddModule.png[width="760"]

TIP: `add m/CS2105 y/2.1 g/A+` +
You can add CS2105 with its resulting grade, A+, concurrently to the list of modules under Year 2 Semester 1.

****
*Checking of Prerequisites* +
If you have not met the prerequisites of a module, you will receive a warning message as shown in Figure 6 below. You can ignore the message if you have already taken the preclusion of that prerequisite module.
****

image::PreReq.png[width="790"]


==== Adding a task with a deadline to a module in *MODdy* +
Format: `add m/moduleCode t/task [d/deadline]` +

****
* You can only add a task to the module if the module has been added to your current semester in *MODdy* previously.
* `d/deadline` must be entered in the format `d/YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`, e.g. `d/2020-03-31 23:59`.
* `d/deadline` is optional if you are only adding one task and your task has no deadline. If your task has a `Date` due but no `Time` due, just enter `d/YYYY-MM-DD` and we will set the `Time` to default (23:59).
* You can delete a completed task using the delete feature mentioned in <<Delete, Section 4.6>>.
****

TIP: You can add multiple tasks at once but only to the *same module*, e.g. `add m/CS1231 t/tutorial d/2020-04-20 18:00 t/assignment d/2020-04-25 23:59`. +

NOTE: However, for multiple tasks, as long as one task has a deadline, all `t/task` tags have to be appended with `d/deadline` tags. +
For the tasks with no deadlines, the tag can just be `d/`, e.g. `add m/IS1103 t/project d/2020-05-01 23:59 t/reflection d/`.
Example: `add m/CS2105 t/Assignment d/2020-04-20 23:59` adds a task named "Assignment"
with the deadline "20 April 2020 23:59" to the already-existing module CS2105, as shown in Figure 7 below.

.CS2105 task is added into and displayed on the Deadline Panel
image::DeadlinePanel.png[width="760"]

NOTE: Dates are highlighted and sorted according to the number of days remaining as shown in Figure 7 above. +
Red: 0 - 5 days +
Orange: 6 - 10 days +
Green: ≥ 11 days
// end::add[]

// tag::edit[]
[[Edit]]
=== Editing profile, module or task: `edit`

If you want to edit any of the attributes you have previously added to *MODdy*, you can do so by using the `edit` command to edit your profile, module details or deadline tasks.
You don't have to worry about adding any wrong information as you can edit them at any time! +

There are *three* ways you can use the `edit` command: +

==== Editing your profile +
Format: `edit [n/name] [c/course] [y/year.semester] [f/focusArea]` +

****
* Fields in brackets [] are optional, but at least one of these fields should be present to be edited.
* If you did not specify your focus area when you created your profile, `edit f/focusArea` adds the focus area to your profile.
* If you've moved on to a new semester, `edit y/year.semester` changes your current semester in your MODdy profile for you.
* If you edit just your course, your focus area will revert back to UNDECIDED.
****

Example: `edit n/Brad c/Information Systems` edits your profile name to "Brad" and your course to "Information Systems",
as shown in Figure 8 below.

.Profile Panel is updated with new details
image::EditProfile.png[width="760"]


TIP: `edit n/Brad c/Information Systems f/Electronic Commerce` +
Alongside your name and course, you can edit your focus area to match your current course using this command.

==== Editing a module's details in *MODdy* +
Format: `edit m/moduleCode [y/year.semester] [g/grade]`

****
* Fields in brackets [] are optional, but at least one of these fields should be present to be edited.
* You are allowed to add a grade to a module you are planning to take in future, if you wish to predict your Cumulative Average Point (CAP). You can delete grades anytime using the `delete` command.
****

Example: `edit m/CS2103T g/A+` edits your grade of the module CS2103T to A+, as shown in Figure 9 below.

.Module detail of CS2103T edited
image::EditModule.png[width="760"]

TIP: `edit m/CS2103T y/2.1 g/A+` +
You can edit the grade of module CS2103T to A+ and change the semester module is taken in to Year 2 Semester 1 concurrently.

NOTE: If you edit a module in your current semester to another semester, all tasks associated to this module will be removed
from the deadline panel. To bring it back, edit the module's semester back to your current semester.

==== Editing a task's description or deadline +
Format: `edit m/moduleCode t/task [nt/newTask] [d/deadline]`

****
* Fields in brackets [] are optional, but at least one of these fields should be present to be edited.
* `t/task` represents the description of the existing task you want to edit.
* `nt/newTask` represents the new description of the existing task.
* `d/deadline` represents to new deadline of the existing task.
****

Example: `edit m/CS2103T t/tP Submission nt/UG and DG Submission` edits an existing CS2103T task "tP Submission" to new task name "UG and DG Submission", as shown in Figure 10 below.

.Deadline for CS2103T is edited from "tP Submission" to "UG and DG Submission"
image::EditDeadline.png[width="790"]

TIP: `edit m/CS2105 t/Assignment d/2020-12-12 12:00` +
You can use this command to edit the deadline of Assignment, under module CS2105, to 12 December 2020 12:00.
// end::edit[]

// tag::show[]
[[Show]]
=== Showing profile, module, semester, course or focus area: `show`
Not all information can be seen at once. To see this information you have added previously, use the `show` command to switch your current *MODdy* display. +

There are *five* ways you can use the `show` command:

==== Showing your profile +
