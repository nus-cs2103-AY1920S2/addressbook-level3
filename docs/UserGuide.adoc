****

If you want to view the cards in a particular deck, you can use `select` followed by the deck's index number.
The index number is the number to the left of its name.
After selecting a deck, FlashSpeed will enter the Deck view and
show all the cards in that deck. +

In the Deck view, you can use any of the Deck mode commands listed in <<deckViewAnchor, 3.3. Deck view>>.

Example:

* `select 1` +

[NOTE]

// tag::addcard[]

[#_adding_a_card_add]
==== Adding a card : `add`

Format: `add <front>:<back>`
****
* *Formal definition*: Creates a card and adds it to a deck,
with the `front` and `back` values of the card specified by the user.
Both the `front` and `back` values cannot be empty.
****
****
* *One and only one* colon (":") can be used in this command.
Since a colon is used as the separator, there should not be any colons in the `front` or `back` values.
****

Alright, after creating a new deck and giving it a great name, what's next?
*Adding cards* into the deck, of course!

Once again, the process is easy:

. Select the deck to which you want to add cards, with the `select` command.
+
e.g. `select 1`

. Inside the input box, type:
* `add`, followed by
*  the word/sentence that you want as the `front` of the card, then
*  a colon ":" right after, and finally
*  the word/sentence that you want as the `back` of the card.
+
e.g. `add „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ:thanks`

. Press kbd:[Enter].
. Voila!
+
.Adding a new card into the Japanese deck.
image::add.png[]

{empty} +

// end::addcard[]

==== Editing a card : `edit`

Format 1: `edit <index> <front>:<back>` +
Format 2: `edit <index> :<back>` +
Format 3: `edit <index> <front>:`
****
* *Formal definition*: Edits the card in the current deck at the specified `index`. The `index` refers to the index number shown in the displayed cards list. The `index` *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* Existing values will be updated to the given values.
* Empty values for the `front` or `back` will leave the original `front` or `back` intact.
****
****
* *One and only one* colon (":") can be used in this command.
Since a colon is used as the separator, there should not be any colons in the `front` or `back` values.
****

You can edit the front and/or back values of any card in the current deck.
The way to do so is similar to the <<_adding_a_card_add, `add`>> command as shown before. +

Type `edit`, followed by the index number of the card to be edited, then the new `front` value, then a colon (":"), and finally the new `back` value. +

[TIP]
You don't have to supply both the `front` and `back` values of a card if you only want to change one of them,
i.e. if you only wish to change the `back` of a card, `front` can be left blank, and vice versa.

Examples:

* `edit 2 „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ:thanks` +
Edits the front and back values of the 2nd card in the deck to be `„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ` and `thanks` respectively.
* `edit 2 :thanks` +
Edits the back value of the 2nd card in the deck to be `thanks`.
* `edit 2 „ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ:` +
Edits the front value of the 2nd card in the deck to be `„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ`.

Examples:

* `delete 3` +
