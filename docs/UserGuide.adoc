[[configoptions]]
[options="header",width=700]

=== Recipe data
The recipe data is stored in the specified path above, as _another_ `.json` file, with key-value pairs.

[WARNING]
====
Do *_not_* edit the `recipebook.json` file by hand, nor delete any lines from the file. CookBuddy may fail to read the file and may crash, or worse, overwrite the file with placeholder data.
