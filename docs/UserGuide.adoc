== Introduction

// tag::introduction[]
Welcome to *Mod Manager*!

*Mod Manager* is a desktop application that assists students in *managing tasks, schedules, and contacts for their modules* in a semester.

More importantly, *Mod Manager* is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, Mod Manager can get your management of tasks, schedules and contacts done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

* `*task* add /code CS3233 /desc Complete Pset 10 /on 30/04/2020 /at 23:59`: adds a task to the module CS3233.
* `*facil* add /name Steven Halim /email stevenha@comp.nus.edu.sg /code CS3233`: adds a facilitator to the module CS3233. If you are rushing to write an email to your lecturer, you can refer to this conveniently.
* `*cal* view /week this` : views your schedules for the current week. You should see the CS3233 lecture group
that you added above.
* `*exit*` : exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

=== Using Mod Manager
This section offers an overview of Mod Manager's layout so that you can find what you need easily.

There are two main areas in Mod Manager:

. A __result display box__ and __command box__ at the bottom of the screen.
. A __main viewing area__ that occupies most of the screen.

The *_command box_* is the area for you to enter commands. The result of each command will be shown
in the *_result display box_*, immediately above the command box.

.The result display box and command box
image::commandAndResultBox.png[]

The *_main viewing area_* shows all the contents for one of the four tabs at any point in time.
The four tabs are **Module**, **Facilitators**, **Tasks** and **Calendar**

* **Module** tab contains information about lessons, tasks and facilitators for a particular module.
It also shows the list of modules you currently have.

====
*Command Format*

This document uses the following notation to describe command formats:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. In the command format `*mod* add /code MOD_CODE`, `MOD_CODE` is a parameter
which can be used as `*mod* add /code CS2103T`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `/code MOD_CODE [/desc DESCRIPTION]` can be used as
`/code CS2103T /desc Software Engineering` or as `/code CS2103T`.
* Items with `...`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times, including 0 times. +
e.g. `[MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times),
`Software` (once), `Software Engineering` (twice),
`SWE AI Algorithms` etc.
* Parameters can be used in any order unless otherwise specified.
e.g. if the command specifies `/code MOD_CODE /desc DESCRIPTION`,
`/desc DESCRIPTION /code MOD_CODE` is also acceptable.
====

=== General features
This section is about some general operations in Mod Manager.

==== Viewing help : `*help*`

You can open the help window that displays a link to our user guide.

Format:

* `*help*`

//tag::undo[]
==== Undoing previous commands : `*undo*` (Nhat)

During a usage session with Mod Manager, you may make mistakes while adding/editing/deleting an entry. It
would be nice if you can reverse the effect in a neat way. The `*undo*` command is here to give you that
convenience.

All of your commands are recorded, so with `*undo*`, you can reverse the effect of previous add/edit/delete commands one by one,
starting with the most previous command.

As of the current version, you can only use `*undo*` to reverse the effects of add/edit/delete commands.

Format:

* `*undo*`

Example:

Let's say you are editing a task of module ST2334 with ID number 401. It is the task highlighted with the red box. Don't
bother with the command if you haven't read the section on <<Task feature : `*task*`, Task feature>> yet. This is just a quick demonstration.

.Editing a task as per usual
image::undo-1.png[]

After that, you realize you didn't mean to make this change, so you type `*undo*`.

.Before `undo`
image::undo-2.png[]

After you press kbd:[Enter], the effect will be reverted and the change is undone. The task is back to before your
editing.

.After `undo`
image::undo-3.png[]
//end::undo[]

==== Redoing previously undone commands : `*redo*` (Nhat)

We understand that you can change your mind right after undo-ing, so we give have the `*redo*` command to assist you.

You can reverse the effect of the most previous `*undo*` command with `*redo*`.

Format:

* `*redo*`

Example:

Let's say you have just used `*undo*` to a task edit command.

.Before `redo`
image::redo-1.png[]

After you press kbd:[Enter], the previously undone effect will come back.

.After `redo`
image::redo-2.png[]


==== Listing commands : `*cmd*` (Nhat)

*Listing all commands*:

Sometimes, you might forget what commands are available in Mod Manager. To give you a quick reminder of all the
command groups provided, we have the `*cmd* all` command.

The command groups available in Mod Manager are the words in bold you have seen throughout this document.

These include: `*facil*, *mod*, *task*, ...`

Format:

* `*cmd* all`

Example:

Type `*cmd* all` into the Command Box.

.Before executing `*cmd* all`
image::cmdAll1.png[]

Press kbd:[Enter] and you will be able to see all the command groups listed.

.After executing `*cmd* all`
image::cmdAll2.png[]

*Listing commands for a specific feature*:

Seeing all the command groups might not be sufficient to remind you of the specific command formats. That's why there is
`*cmd* group`. It will list all valid command formats of a group for you, so you can get back to work.

You can use `*cmd* all` first to get a glimpse of all the command groups we have.

Format:

* `*cmd* group COMMAND_GROUP`

Example: `*cmd* group class`

You want to know what commands there are in command group `class`. Type `*cmd* group class` into the Command Box.

.Before executing `*cmd* group class`
image::cmdGroup1.png[]

Hit kbd:[Enter] and you will see the commands associated in the command group `class`. Since there are quite a few commands
there, you might want to scroll down through the list.

.After executing `*cmd* group class`
image::cmdGroup2.png[]

==== Navigating through past commands with up/down key (Nhat)

During a Mod Manager usage session, you may want to repeat some commands but you feel quite lazy to type again. Therefore,
we bring you the ability to use the `up/down` arrow key on your keyboard to find the past command that you need.

Example:

Let's say you want to use command "mod view CS2103T" again, but you have already executed 5 more commands ever since.
Just simply press the `up` key on your keyboard a few times and you will see it in the command box.

If you have been pressing `up` and accidentally bypassed the command you need, just press `down` until you see it again.

For this feature, you can try out very quickly. Just open Mod Manager, type in a few commands and press `up/down` like you mean it.
That's the best and only way to truly feel the convenience of Mod Manager.

//tag::clear[]
==== Clearing all entries : `*clear*` (Lu Shing)

You can clear all entries from Mod Manager. All the lists of modules, classes, facilitators and tasks that you have will be cleared.
Please use this command cautiously, you cannot `undo` after it!

Format:

* `*clear*`

Example:

Suppose your semester has ended and you do not want to see any information related to those modules you have taken in that semester anymore.
You can type `*clear*` as shown below.

.Before `*clear*`
image::BeforeClear.png[]

After pressing kbd:[Enter], Mod Manager is empty. All the entries you have are cleared.

.After `*clear*`
image::AfterClear.png[]

//end::clear[]

//tag::exit[]
==== Exiting the program : `*exit*`

You can exit the program. Upon closing the application, the Mod Manager data will be saved automatically in your hard disk.

Format:

* `*exit*`
//end::exit[]

=== Module feature : `*mod*`

// end::class[]

// start::task[]
=== Task feature : `*task*`
The commands in this section carry out operations on the task list in Mod Manager.
Executing these commands will bring you to the Tasks tab.

==== Adding a task (Nhat, Bao)

You can add a task to a module.

Format:

* `*task* add /code MOD_CODE /desc DESCRIPTION [/on DATE] [/at TIME]`

Example: `*task* add /code CS3230 /desc Programming Assignment 2 /on 20/02/2020 /at 23:59`

Command properties:
****
* MOD_CODE must be an existing and valid module code in the list of modules.
* A module can be linked to any number of tasks (including 0).
* `DATE` and `TIME` are optional fields, however, there can only be a `TIME` field
if a `DATE` field is provided. For example, `/at 23:59` without `/on DATE` is not allowed.
* `DATE` follows `_dd/MM/yyyy_` format. It should be a valid date,
e.g. Day 32 or Month 13 is not allowed. A special date is reserved in Mod Manager for a special functional purpose: 01/01/1970. If
you choose to use this date as your input, Mod Manager won't (for now) show an error message, but is not guaranteed to exhibit
a normal behaviour.
* `TIME` follows `_HH:mm_` format. It should be a valid time between 00:01 and 23:59,
e.g. 00:00 and 24:00 are not allowed - if you input these values, they will be ignored.
* Similar tasks across modules are allowed. However,
tasks within a same module must have different descriptions. They can occupy the same time.
****

//tag::task-edit-delete[]
==== Editing a task (Nhat)

From here on, you will be introduced to Mod Manager's task ID system.
****
* A task can be uniquely identified in the system by two things: its associated module and a 3-digit number (from 100-999).
* A complete task ID will consist of two elements: `MOD_CODE` and `ID_NUMBER`.
* Examples of valid task ID: `CS2103T 848`, `CS4231 132`.
* You can find out a task's ID by looking at the general task list - can be viewed with
`*task* list`, or the task list of a specific module - can be viewed with `*mod* view`.
****

You can edit a task's description, its date and time details, or both by providing the correct task ID and the updated
information.

Format:

* `*task* edit MOD_CODE ID_NUMBER [/desc DESCRIPTION] [/on DATE] [/at TIME]`

Mod Manager will find the task associated with the module code and task ID number provided and update the information correspondingly.
The properties of `DESCRIPTION`, `DATE` and `TIME` are described in the `*task* add` command above.

Example: `*task* edit CS2101 344 /desc OP2 /on 08/04/2020`

Type the command into the command box. The task to edit in this example is marked by the red rectangle.

.Before `*task* edit`
image::task-edit-1.png[]

After pressing kbd:[Enter], you will see that the task has been edited.

.After `*task* edit`
image::task-edit-2.png[]

Since you may want to remove the date and time of a task, Mod Manager provides you a way to do so. Note that if you try
to remove the date and time from a task without these values,

Format:

* `*task* edit MOD_CODE ID_NUMBER [/desc DESCRIPTION] /on non`

Example: `*task* edit ST2334 401 /on non`

.A task whose date and time that you want to remove
image::task-edit-3.png[]

Again, press kbd:[Enter] and you will see its date and time has been removed. Its order in the list may be changed due to
the sorting property of the <<Viewing all tasks across all modules in Mod Manager (Bao), task list>>.

.The task's date and time removed
image::task-edit-4.png[]

==== Deleting a task (Nhat)

You can delete a task from Mod Manager's system.

Format:

* `*task* delete MOD_CODE ID_NUMBER`

Example: `*task* delete CS2101 344`

.The task to delete
image::task-delete-1.png[]

Press kbd:[Enter] and the task will be gone from the list.

.Task deleted from the list
image::task-delete-2.png[]
//end::task-edit-delete[]

//tag::task-mark-as-done-UG[]

==== Marking a task as done (Bao)

You can mark the task as done in the module in Mod Manager.

NOTE: A newly added task will be not done by default.

NOTE: Editing a task will not change the done/not done status of the task.

NOTE: Tasks that are already marked as done cannot be re-marked as done.

Format:

* `*task* done /code MOD_CODE /id ID_NUMBER` +

Command properties:
****
* MOD_CODE should belong to a valid and existing module in Mod Manager.
* ID_NUMBER should belong to a valid task for the module above.
****

Example:

You can mark a task as done in the module. To mark the task with
task ID `ID_NUMBER` in module `MOD_CODE` to be done, you can type in the following command:

`*task* done /code CS2105 /id 224`
and hit kbd:[Enter]

.Before `*task* done /code CS2105 /id 224`
image::TaskDoneBeforeCloseUp.png[]

.After `*task* done /code CS2105 /id 224`
image::TaskDoneAfterCloseUp.png[]

The <<taskcard, task card>> has changed to green; which means our task has been marked as done.
Hooray! We just completed a task.
//end::task-mark-as-done-UG[]


==== Viewing all tasks across all modules in Mod Manager (Bao)

You can view a list of all tasks across all modules in Mod Manager.
This is great when you need an overview of all tasks that you need to complete
at present.

Format:

* `*task* list`

Example:

By typing the command above, you should see a list of tasks, such as the following:

.`*task* list` shows a list of all tasks in Mod Manager
image::TaskList.png[]

==== Viewing tasks for a specific module (Bao)
If you want to find tasks for a specific module in Mod Manager, this is the command for you to use!

Format:

* `*task* module /code CS2103T`

Command properties:
****
* MOD_CODE should belong to a valid and existing module in Mod Manager.
****

NOTE: Alternatively, you can also view the tasks for a specific module in the `Module` tab (the <<dashboard,dashboard>>).

Example:

If you want a list of current tasks for the module `CS3230`, you can type in the following command:

`*task* module /code CS3230`
and hit kbd:[Enter]

It is not compulsory for you to be at the Tasks tab before typing in this command.
Mod Manager will automatically redirect you to the Tasks tab if you are currently at another tab.

.All tasks belonging to the module `CS3230` are listed

==== Viewing all tasks not done/finished (Bao)
Previously, we know that we can mark a task as done, so as to organise, manage,
and plan our tasks better. Now, with this command, you can see all the
tasks that have not yet been finished.

Format: `*task* undone`

.Before `*task* undone`, all tasks are listed
image::TaskListNotDoneBefore.png[]

By typing the command above and hit kbd:[Enter], you should only see uncompleted tasks,
which are in dark red color:

.Only uncompleted tasks are shown

//tag::task-find-description-UG[]
==== Finding tasks by description (Bao)

You are browsing through the task list. But there are too many tasks! You suddenly
remember a specific task that you want to do, but you can only vaguely remember its description,
e.g. something related to assignment.

This command is exactly what you need. In your case, you can find all tasks that
contain the word `assignment`, which may include `Programming Assignment`,
`written assignment`, `Take-home Lab Assignment` (note that it can be case-insensitive).
If you remember multiple words in your wanted tasks, you may also type in multiple words as you want.
Tasks that meet at least one of the keywords you provided will be shown to you.

Format:

* `*task* find DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...`

Command properties:
****
* The `find` works across modules, so no `/code` command are required. For example, you may want to find all the `assignment` currently due.
* Searching for description is case insensitive. e.g `programming` will match `Programming`.
* The order of the descriptions does not matter. e.g. `Programming Assignment` will match `Assignment Programming`.
* Tasks are only searched in the description.
* Words can be partially matched e.g. `assign` will match `assignment`.
* Tasks matching at least one description will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `assign home` will return both `Programming Assignment 2` and `Homework 3`.
****

Examples:

To find tasks that contain the word `oral`, `assign`, or `tut` in their description,
you can type in the following command:

`*task* find oral assign tut` and press kbd:[Enter]

.After `*task* find oral assign tut`, all matching tasks are displayed
image::TaskFindAfter.png[]

Explanation: +
- `Oral Presentation 2` contains `Oral` which matches `oral` (case-insensitive). +
- `Programming Assignment 2` contains `Assignment` which matches `assign` (case-insensitive, and words can be partial match) +
-  Similarly, `Assignment 3` will match `assign`, and `Tutorial` will match `tut` +
- As long as a task's description matches *one* of the keywords provided, it will be shown. +

You can try typing in `*task* find assign tut oral` and press kbd:[Enter]. This will return the same list
of tasks, since the ordering of the keywords does not matter.

Other examples:

* `*task* find homework` +
Finds all tasks that contain the word `homework` in their description

* `*task* find math coding` +
Finds all tasks that contain the word `math` *or* `coding` in their description
//end::task-find-description-UG[]

==== Searching tasks by date (Bao)

With this command, you can search for all tasks that occur on your specified date, month, or year.

NOTE: Tasks are only searched for its date. Tasks that do not have dates or times
will not be found in this list.

Format:

* `*task* search [/date DATE] [/month MONTH] [/year YEAR]`

Command properties:
****
* The `search` works across modules, so no `/code` commands are required.
* If no optional fields are provided, Mod Manager will output all tasks
that have a specified time.
* Invalid inputs such as `/date monday`, `/month December`, `/year this year` are not allowed.
Please use numbers for `/date`, `/month`, and `/year` instead.
* Invalid date, month, or year is not allowed. For example: +
- `/date 32`, `/date 0`: `date` can only range from `1` to `31`.
- `/month 13`, `/month 0`: `month` can only range from `1` to `12`.
- `/year 0`, `/year 99999`: the `search` only accept `year` ranging from `1` to `9999`
- `/date 30 /month 2`: there is no 30/2 in any year
- `/date 29 /month 2 /year 2019`: this is not possible since `2019` is not a leap year.
However, `/date 29 /month 2` (year is not provided) is okay.
* Tasks matching *all* conditions will be returned (i.e. `AND` search). e.g. `/month 5 /year 2020` will
only match tasks that are in May 2020.
****

Example:

You can search for tasks that are due on the submission date of CS2103T for AY19/20 S2
(13 April). To find tasks happening on 13 April,
you can type `*task* search /date 13 /month 4` and press kbd:[Enter]. This will return all tasks
that are happening on 13 April.

.Before `*task* search /date 13 /month 4`, all tasks are listed
image::TaskSearchBefore.png[]

.After `*task* search /date 13 /month 4`, only matching tasks are listed
image::TaskSearchAfter.png[]

Explanation: the two tasks both have date as `13` and month as `4`.

Other examples:

* `*task* search /date 1` +
Searches for all tasks happening on the first day of the month, in any year. Who wants
to study on New Year's Day really?

* `*task* search /month 4 /year 2020` +
Searches for all tasks in the current month (at the time of writing, April 2020).

* `*task* search /year 2020` +
Searches for all tasks in this year (at the time of writing). This will be useful
if Mod Manager is used over a long period of time.

* `*task* search /date 14 /month 2 /year 2021` +
Searches for all tasks happening on 14/02/2021.
