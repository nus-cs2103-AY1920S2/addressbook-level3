Otherwise, please proceed to Step 3. Else, skip to Step 4 +

*Step 3* : Provide the following `[KEYWORD]` : `done` (Showing all your completed orders) or `undone` (Show all your
uncompleted orders) +

*Step 4* : Press `Enter` on your keyboard and see the magic!

[[list-examples]]
==== What constitutes a valid List command

The syntax of a valid `list` command is as shown:
`list` `[KEYWORD]`

There are three types of list commands that are shown in the examples below :

*Step 3* : Press `Enter` on your keyboard to see the magic!

[NOTE]
====
* Please include a whitespace in between the keyword & transaction id or keyword & the attributes aforementioned. +
i.e. `return` `tid/123abcd` +
 or +
`return` `tid/123abcd` `n/weijie` `a/blk 32 clementi road` `p/92123412`
`w/Jurong warehouse` `rts/2020-04-05`
====

[[return-examples]]
==== What constitutes a valid Return command?

The syntax for a valid Return command can be seen below!

* `return` `TRANSACTION_ID` or `return` `TRANSACTION_ID` `CUSTOMER_NAME` `CUSTOMER_ADDRESS` `CUSTOMER_EMAIL`
`WAREHOUSE_LOCATION` `PHONE_NUMBER` `RETURN_TIMESTAMP` `[COMMENTS_BY_CUSTOMER]` `[TYPE_OF_ITEM]`

[NOTE]

* The `CUSTOMER_ADDRESS` refers to the location which the return should be picked up from.
* The `WAREHOUSE_LOCATION` refers to the location which the return should be delivered to.
* The `PHONE_NUMBER` refers to the phone number of the customer.
* The `RETURN_TIMESTAMP` refers to the return date and time of the parcel.
* The `COMMENTS_BY_CUSTOMER` is an optional attribute which can be included if the customer has special requests.

.Possible Combinations of Return command
|===
|Scenario |Command |Result

| If you want to convert the order with Transaction Id 'abc1234' into a return order and display it on returns list, you can do this:
| `return` `tid/abc1234`
| This order will be removed from the order list and be added into the returns list as a return order.

| If you want to create a new return order in the return order list, you can do this:
| `return` `tid/123abcd` `n/weijie` `a/blk 32 clementi road` `p/92123412` `w/Jurong warehouse` `rts/2020-04-05`
| A return order with the input attributes will be created into the return order list.
|===

[NOTE]
====
* The `TRANSACTION_ID` given belongs to the return order that will be created.
* A return order will be created after executing this return command.
* If the parcel is an existing order, it will be removed from the order list and converted into a return order
and added into the return order list.
* If the parcel is a new return order, it will be created and added into the return order list.
====

[WARNING]
====
* The conversion of an order into a return order can only be done if the order was already delivered.
* The `TRANSACTION_ID` *is alphanumeric*, e.g: 123asd, 1234567, abcdef.

[[search]]
=== Searching for parcels using their attributes: `search` [Done by Kenny Ho Si Chong]
In this section, you will be able to find out how to properly <<edit-works, use>> the Search command and the relevant <<edit-examples, examples>>. +
Why will you want to use the `search` command? If you wish to `search` for a parcel with specific keywords, the `search` command will provide you the means to do so.


[[search-works]]
==== How to use the Search command?

Here is how you can `search` for any parcel containing the keywords given by following the steps below: +

*Step 1* : Type in the keyword *search* +
*Step 2* (optional) : Provide `-o` flag if you want to only search for parcels in the order list. A `-r` flag also can be used to only search for parcels in the return list.
[NOTE]
====
If no flag is given in this step, `search` command will be performed on both the order and return list.
====
*Step 3 (optional)* : If you wish to only specifically search for keyword in a field, you should provide the `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>` coupled with a front slash `/` and the keyword you want to search for. +
*Step 4* : Provide any number of alphanumeric word you wish to search for in the parcel. +
*Step 5* : Press `Enter` on your keyboard to see the magic!

[NOTE]
====
* In between each step please put a whitespace!
* If nothing is displaying means you have no parcel containing the keyword you have given!
====

[[search-examples]]
==== What constitutes a valid Search command?

The syntax for a valid `Search` command can be seen below:

* `search` `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `KEYWORD` `[MORE_KEYWORDS]...` OR
* `search` `<<command_flags, [FLAG]>>` `<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>/KEYWORD` `[MORE_KEYWORDS]...` `[<<command_prefix, ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX>>/KEYWORD MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

[NOTE]
====
* `search` is the command word for this feature.
* `FLAG` is to differentiate the different kind of parcel (orders or returns).
* The `KEYWORD` is the word you want to search for in any of the parcel.
* `ORDER_ATTRIBUTE_PREFIX` is the field of the parcel you want to search for
====

.Possible Combinations of Search command
|===
|Scenario |Command |Result

| If you want to search for any return parcel containing the keyword `Jeremy` or `Loh`.
| `search` `-r` `Jeremy Loh` +
| Return all return order(s) containing keyword of `jeremy`, `Jeremy Loh` or `loh` or any of the above as long as it appears in any of the parcel field.

| If you want to search for any order parcel that contain the transaction id of `asj2od3943`.
| `search` `-o` `tid/asj2od3943
| Return all order(s) with transaction ID of `asj2od3943`.

| If you want to search for any return parcel that contain the phone number of `92039999`.
| `search` `-r` `p/92039999`
| Return all return order(s) with phone number of `92039999`

| If you want to only search for any order parcel that contains either the phone number `92039999`, transaction id of `asj2od3943` or the name `jeremy`.
| `search` `-o` `p/92039999` `tid/asj2od3943` `n/jeremy`
| Return all order(s) with either phone number of `92039999` or transaction ID of `asj2od3943` or name of `jeremy` or any of the above combinations.

| If you want to search for any parcel containing the name `Jeremy`
| `search` `n/Jeremy`
| Return all parcel(s) with the name of `Jeremy`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The sequence of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Orders matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
