== Introduction

Are you a *Teaching Assistant at NUS School of Computing (SOC)* who is tired of having to *keep
track of all your claimable hours* in some unappealing excel spreadsheet just so you
can fill up the Teaching Support Student (TSS) Claims form accurately at the end of the semester?
Do you want a desktop application where you can *keep track of things related to your teaching duties,
such as strongest and weakest students,* all in one place? If so, TA-Tracker is the tool for you!

TA-Tracker is a productivity tool made for NUS SOC Teaching Assistants (TAs)
who want to be able to track and manage their students and claimable
hours in one place.

TA-Tracker is tailored towards TAs who *prefer to use a desktop application to
manage their teaching duties* and is well suited for those who *prefer to work with a Command
Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you're interested, jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

This section gives you a step-by-step explanation on how you can download and open
the application.

.  Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `tatracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TA tracker.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
This is what the GUI looks like when the TA-Tracker is opened.
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Refer to <<Usage>> for details of each command.

NOTE: TA-Tracker data is saved periodically so you don't have to worry about saving
your data manually.

== About the User Guide
This User Guide introduces you to TA-Tracker's features and shows you how you can use
the TA-Tracker to make your life as a Teaching Assistant easier.

=== Commonly Used Symbols
This section shows you the symbols commonly used in the User Guide.

[NOTE]
====
This symbol indicates that there is something that you should take note of.
====

[TIP]
====
This symbol indicates that a tip is being mentioned.
====

[CAUTION]
====
This symbol indicates that there is something you should be careful to avoid.

=== Command Format

All the commands written in the user guide follow some rules that have been mentioned
below. This will help you better understand how to use the commands.

[width="%",cols="<20%,<40,options="header",]
|=======================================================================
| Rule | Examples

| Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. | In
`student add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `student add n/John Doe`.

| Items in square brackets are optional. | `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as
`n/John Doe t/Fast learner` or as `n/John Doe`.

| Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times or none at all. |

- Left Empty: `t/` (i.e. 0 times)

- Used one time: `t/friend` (i.e. once)

- Used multiple times: `t/friend t/family` (i.e. 2 times).

| If you use a prefix without `...` mentioned multiple times, TA-Tracker only will accept
the last instance of the prefix. | In the command `module add m/CS2103T n/SE n/Software Engineering` ,
a module with the module code `CS2013T` and name `Software Engineering` will be created.

| If you separate the the prefix letter and `/` while writing a command, TA-Tracker
will not recognise the prefix. | In the command `module add m/CS2103T
n /Software Engineering` , TA-Tracker doesn't recognise `n /` to be the same
as `n/` and you'll get an error message saying that the command format used is wrong.

| Parameters can be in any order. | If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`,
`p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

|=======================================================================

[[Layout]]
== Layout
This is a brief overview of the layout of the TA-Tracker. The TA-Tracker is divided
into three different views - the *Student View*, the *Session View* and the *Claims View*.
Each of the views correspond to their following `tab` header.

When you enter a new command, you will be automatically switched to the relevant `tab`
so that you can instantly see the command results. The tab will also be highlighted in
orange.

[NOTE]
====
* You can click on a `tab` header to change the currently shown *View*. The new `tab`
will be highlighted in blue.

* The `tab` that you were switched to when you enter commands will remain highlighted
in orange even if you click on other tabs. That way, it is easier for you to remember
where you last made changes to TA-Tracker.

* You may notice that the orange and blue highlights for the `tab` headers are not
horizontally aligned.This is to prevent the highlights from overlapping each other,
allowing you to see them better.
====

=== Student View
Under the `student tab`, the *Student View* is used to show you the students that you're teaching. The students
have been categorised according to the *module* and *group* they belong to. The *Student View* has been divided into
three columns.

. The first column shows you a list of all the modules that you are a teaching
assistant for.

. The second column shows you a list of all groups that you're a teaching assistant for
in a module of your choice.
If you haven't chosen anything, you will be shown the groups of the module
in the first index in the list of modules by default.

. The third column shows you a list of all students in the group of your choice. If you
haven't chosen anything, you will be shown the students of the group in the
first index in the list of groups by default.

The purpose of the *Student View* is to help you keep track a of your students. It will
show you information such as:

* `NAME`: student name
* `MATRIC_NUMBER`: matriculation number
* `RATING`: ratings you have given the student, represented by stars (on a scale from 1 - 5)
* `EMAIL` and `PHONE`: contact details
* `TAG`: any additional information you have about the student

=== Session View
Under the `session tab`, the *Session View* contains a list of the upcoming sessions
that you haven't done yet.

The sessions are automatically sorted by date.

The purpose of the *Session View* is to help you keep track a of your upcoming teaching.
duties. It will show you information such as:

* `SESSION_TYPE`: the type of session
* `DATE`: the date that the session will occur on
* `START` and `END`: the start time and end time of the session
* `MODULE`: the module that the session is under
* `NOTES`: any additional information
* `WEEK`: the recurring period of the session

=== Claims View
Under the `claims tab`, the *Claims View* contains a list of all the claimable teaching
duties you have completed so far.

The purpose of this view is to allow a you to keep track of all your claims so
you can easily enter it into the TSS claims form at the end of the semester.

The claims under this tab can be filtered by module code to enable you to easily see
what claims to submit for each of the modules you teach. The *Claims View* has been
divided into two columns.

. The first column shows you a list of all the modules that you are a teaching
assistant for.

. The second column shows you a list of all the sessions that have been marked as done.

[[Usage]]
== Usage
You can interact with TA-Tracker using `CLI` commands!

[NOTE]
====

This section explains all the commands you can use in the *Student View*.

[[AddModule]]
==== Adding a Module : `module add`

You can use this command to add a new module to the TA-Tracker.

When a new module is created, the *Student View* will show the groups
and students of the new module. (Initially, a new module doesn't have any students or
groups till you add some).
If you were on a different tab, you will automatically be switched to the student tab.

Format: `module add m/MOD_CODE n/NAME`

[NOTE]
====
* You can't have two modules with the same module code in the TA-Tracker.

* MOD_CODE and MOD_NAME can't be an empty string or a sequence of spaces.

* You can give a module your own custom MOD_CODE or NAME if you find it easier
to remember. However,  we recommend you use the official
module code and name for it.

* If the module name or module code are very long, you can increase the width of
the module name list by dragging the edge with your cursor. However, we suggest not
giving the modules long codes or long names. The standard official names are usually
of a good length.

====

[TIP]
====
* You can't edit the `MOD_CODE` once the module has been created, so do take
care to ensure that the code is correct.
====

====

The new session will be shown in the *Session View*, and will automatically
be marked as `not done`.

If you were on a different tab, you will automatically be switched to the session tab.

Format: `session add m/MOD_CODE [s/START] [e/END] [d/DATE] [w/WEEKS] [t/SESSION_TYPE] [n/NOTES]`


[TIP]
====
. If you want to create a session with the current date, start time and end time,
you can omit `s/START` , `e/END` and `d/DATE`.

. You can edit the end time `e/END` and other details later.

. If the session has a recurring period `[w/WEEKS]`, a new session with the updated date
and timing will be added to Session View when it is marked as done.

. You will find the recurring period `[w/WEEKS]` field handy for tasks that happen once every few weeks
such as your weekly lab sessions or fortnightly assignment grading.

====

====
