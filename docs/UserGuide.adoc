== *Introduction*

Welcome to the User Guide of *Easy Travel (E.T.)*!

Do you enjoy going on overseas trips, but dislike or have trouble planning for it? Fret not, our application, **E.T.**, will help reduce the amount of stress and anxiety when planning for a trip. **E.T.** is a desktop application that helps travellers **manage and plan for their trips**. This application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can manage your trips faster than other Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

The purpose of this user guide is to provide you with in-depth documentation on how to install and use our application. What are you waiting for? Head on to +++<u>Section 2 - Quick Start to get started</u>+++.

== *Quick Start*

To get started with using **E.T.**, you can follow these steps:

. Ensure that you have _Java 11_ or above installed in your Computer. If you don‚Äôt you can install it using the link to _Oracle_ https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[here]
. Download the latest version of **E.T.** found https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-3/main/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for **E.T.**.
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI shown in +++<u>Figure 1</u>+++ should appear in a few seconds.
. You are now on the main page of **E.T.**.
. At the bottom of the screen, type your command in the Command Box (label in +++<u>Figure 1</u>+++) and press <Enter> on your keyboard to execute it. E.g. typing `help` and pressing <Enter> will open the help window.

Refer to +++<u>Section 3.2.3 - Command Syntaxes and Usages</u>+++ on how to use commands and +++<u>Section 4 - Features</u>+++ on the commands you can use for each feature.

==== Command Syntaxes and Usages

Since *E.T.* is a CLI application, knowing how to use commands is very important. The following subsection will teach you how to read and use commands in *E.T.*. All commands in *E.T.* follow similar formats as described below and examples will be provided to help you understand their usage. Examples of commands and their formats will be written in `code-blocks`.

Table 2 below explains some important technical terms. An example will be provided to help you visualize these terms.


|===
|Technical Term |What does it mean?

|Command word
|The first word of a command. It determines the action that E.T. should perform.

|Parameter
|The word or group of words following the command word. They are values given to a command to perform the specified action.

|Prefix
|The word that at the start of a parameter. It distinguishes one parameter from another.
|===

Table 2. Commands technical terms

Example:


    additem name/NAME quantity/QUANTITY category/CATEGORY


Breakdown:

*Command Word* - `additem`

*Parameters* - `NAME`, `QUANTITY`, `CATEGORY`

*Prefix* -  `name/`, `quantity/`, `category/`

The following points explain how you can use a command with the provided format. More examples will be provided for each command in +++<u>Section 4 - Features</u>+++.
Words in the upper case are the parameters to be supplied by you.

- Words in the *upper case* are the parameters to be supplied by you.

Example:
|===
|Format given |Example of user input

|`deletetransport INDEX`
|`deletetransport 1`
|===

`INDEX` is a parameter that you supply.

In this example, the user supplied `1` as the `INDEX`.

- Items in *square brackets* are optional.

Example:
|===
|Format given |Example of user input

|`edititem INDEX [name/NAME] [quantity/QUANTITY] [category/CATEGORY]`
|`edititem 1 quantity/5`
|===
`INDEX` is compulsory as it is not in a pair of *square brackets*.

`[name/NAME]` on the other hand is optional as it is in a pair of *square brackets*.

The same rule applies to the rest of the parameters.

In the example above, the user supplied the compulsory parameter `INDEX` and only one optional parameter `[quantity/QUANTITY]`.

- Items with `...` after them can be used zero or multiple times.

Example:
|===
|Format given |Example of user input

|`addactivity title/TITLE location/LOCATION duration/DURATION tag/TAG...`
|`addactivity title/Shopping location/Treasure Factory duration/2 tag/shopping tag/tokyo`

| _Same as above_
|`addactivity title/Osaka Castle View location/Treasure Factory duration/2 duration/1`
|===
In the first example above, the user supplied 2 `tag/TAG` parameters.

In the second example above, the user did not supply any `tag/TAG` parameters.

- Parameters can be supplied in any order

Example:
|===
|Format given |Example of user input

|`addactivity title/TITLE location/LOCATION duration/DURATION tag/TAG... `
|`addactivity title/Shopping location/Treasure Factory duration/2 tag/shopping tag/tokyo`

| _Same as above_
|`addactivity duration/2 tag/shopping location/Treasure Factory tag/tokyo title/Shopping`
|===

The above user input command examples are equivalent even though the order of the parameters supplied are different.

With the above information, you can now move on to Section 5 - Feature to learn all the features of the application and start using the commands.
[[Features]]
== *Features*
This section contains all the information you need to know about the features of E.T.. To use each feature or sub-feature, you will need to enter a command into the Command Box.


=== Trip Planner

The main feature of the app. Handles all trip and activity management.

==== Trip Management
This section contains the commands for the Trip Planner.

WARNING: A trip is required to be set before other features are unlocked

===== Create your brand new trip: `settrip`

Format: `settrip title/TITLE start/START_DATE end/END_DATE budget/BUDGET exchangerate/EXCHANGERATE`

[IMPORTANT]
====
- There must not be a pre-existing trip set.
- Start and end dates must be a valid date.
- Title cannot exceed 50 characters.
- Trip must be within 30 days
- Budget must be a valid positive Integer from 0 to 1,000,000
- Exchange Rate must be a valid positive double from 0 to 100.
- Date must include the departure and arrival date.
====

Let‚Äôs say you have an upcoming Graduation Trip and you are planning for it. You can execute a command as shown in the example below:

`settrip title/Graduation Trip start/28-09-2020 end/28-10-2020 budget/5000 exchangerate/1.03`

This would create a trip titled ‚ÄúGraduation trip‚Äù with a start day of 28 September 2020 to 28 October 2020. The budget set is $5000 with the exchangerate of 1.03

After successfully setting a trip, you would see as shown in figure X below.

.Message after successfully setting a trip
image::user-guide/SetTrip.png[]

WARNING: Ensure that your date is correct as E.T. does not allow editing of dates once set.

===== Rename your trip: `rename`

Assume that you have accidentally titled the trip wrongly, you can execute the rename command to reverse any damages done as shown below


Format: `rename TITLE`

Example:

`rename Not a graduation trip.`

This changes the name of the trip to ‚ÄúNot a graduation trip‚Äù as shown in the figure below.

Expected output:
`Trip has been named: Not a graduation trip`

.After renaming the trip
image::user-guide/RenameTrip.png[]

===== Editing your  trip‚Äôs budget: `editbudget`

Let‚Äôs say after planning your expenses, you realised that you would want to change the amount of money used for the trip. Using the editbudget command, you can edit the overall budget for your trip

Format: `editbudget AMOUNT`

[IMPORTANT]
====
- There must be a pre-existing trip set.
- The budget set must not be lesser than your total expenses.
====

For example, we want to decrease the budget for this trip from $5000 to $3000.

Example:

`editbudget 3000`

E.T. will reflect the new budget in the trip info as shown in the figure below.

.After editing budget to 3000
image::user-guide/EditBudget.png[]

===== Delete your trip: `deletetrip`

Assuming that you have finished with your trip and would like to start planning for a new one, executing the deletetrip command would remove all traces of your previous trip and set a new clean space for you to start planning for the next one.

Format: `deletetrip`

Example:
`deletetrip`

Expected output:
`Trip has been deleted. All lists have been cleared!`

Deleting the trip would result in E.T. showing an empty screen as shown in figure 3. Execute the settrip to start another trip.


==== Scheduler (after opening a trip)

Allow users to manage the activities in the trip

===== Check how prepared you are: `status`

Assume you are not sure if you have already fully prepared for the trip, using the status command would confirm any fears and doubts about your preparation as well as warn you if you have any forgotten item that is not taken care of.

Using the status command would create a pop-up window as shown in figure 4.

.The pop-up after using status command
image::user-guide/Status.png[]

[NOTE]
====
The pop-up would show you major warnings such as

- No expense/packing list item set
- Collisions in activities
- Over expenditure on budget
- Unchecked items in packing list
====

=== Activity Management
This section allows users to manage the activities in the trip.

==== Add your activity: `addactivity`
Lets say you wish to add in a new activity that you decided to do on the trip. Using the `addactivitiy` command would create and add your activity into the list.

Format: `addactivity title/TITLE duration/DURATION location/LOCATION [tag/tag]...`

Example:
`addactivity title/Going to the beach duration/4 location/Hakone tag/sea tag/ocean`

.After add activity command
image::user-guide/AddActivity.png[]

This would create and add an activity titled ‚ÄúGoing to the beach" with a duration of 4 hours. The location of this activity is set to  ‚ÄúHakone‚Äù, and has the tags ‚Äúsea‚Äù and ‚Äúocean‚Äù.

==== Editing your activity: `editactivity`

Assume you have accidentally made a mistake in the spelling or the location of the activity and wish to change it. Running the `editactivity` command will allow you to make any changes to previously set activities.

Format: `editactivity INDEX [title/NAME][duration/DURATION][location/LOCATION][tag/tag]...`

Example:
`editactivity 1 title/Go to an aquarium`

.After edit activity command
image::user-guide/EditActivity.png[]

In this example, this command will edit an existing activity at the index 1 ‚Äòs title to ‚ÄúGo to an aquarium‚Äù. The other fields will stay the same.

IMPORTANT: The activity must exist to be edited

==== Deleting your activity: `deleteactivity`

Perhaps you decided that previously set activities are unviable and wish to remove it. Using the `deleteactivity` command would remove any activities that you do not want.

Format: `deleteactivity index`
Example:
`deleteactivity 1`

.After delete activity command
image::user-guide/DeleteActivity.png[]

In this example, you would delete an activity at the index 1

[IMPORTANT]
=====
The activity at that index must exist before deleting is allowed
=====

==== Clearing your planned activities: `clearactivity`

Perhaps you decided that all the activities you had planned before are not needed and want to start the activity list on a clean slate. Using the `clearactivity` command would clear any existing activities and replace your list with a brand new empty list.

Format: `clearactivity`

Example:
`clearactivity`

.After clear activity command
image::user-guide/ClearActivity.png[]

[NOTE]
====
You can use this to delete all your activities at once
====

====  Find your activities
Let say you had added a bunch of activities and wished to search for a specific one. You can do it by using the find command to search through based on tags or by keyword.

`Findactivitytag` allows you to search by tags while `findactivity` command allows you to search by keyword.

Format: `findactivitytag tag`



Example:
`findactivitytag expensive`

This would show you the activities that have the tag expensive as shown in the figure 11.

.After find activity category command
image::user-guide/FindActivityCategory.png[]

Let's say rather than finding by tags, you decided to search by keywords. You can use the `findactivity` to find base on the keywords you provided.

Format: `findactivity keyword`

Example:
`findactivity Osaka`

This would search for all activities with ‚ÄúOsaka‚Äù in it as shown in the figure 12

.After find activity command
image::user-guide/FindActivity.png[]

[NOTE]
`FindActivity` only searches location and activity titles


=== Transportation Booking Management
