== Introduction

Notably is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing notes*. More importantly, Notably is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Notably can get your notes taken down faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start [Work in progress]

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `notably.jar`
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your notes.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

== Features

====
*Command Legend*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `open NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `open Notably`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `-t TITLE [-b BODY]` can be used as `-t Notably -b Lorem ipsum` or as `-t Notably`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `-t TITLE -b BODY`, `-b BODY -t TITLE` is also acceptable.
