== Introduction

HireLah! is an app that helps interviewers manage their interviewees, the attributes
you look out for in these interviewees, and the questions to ask during the interviews.
As a complete solution for interviewers, HireLah! also helps interviewers conduct interviews
on the app and identify the best interviewees.

== Quick Start
.  Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `HireLah.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your HireLah!.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open this user guide.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`add interviewee`* `John Doe`: adds an interviewee named John Doe to the application
* *`add question`* `How old are you?`: adds the question to the application
* *`exit`*: exits the app
.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of all the commands.

== Features

Generally, in an interview session (for example, an interview for a role in a company), there are 3 phases:

. Initialization phase (or preparation phase) - where the interviewer prepares his/her questions, manages
  candidates, receives their resumes, etc.
. Interview phase - where the interviewer actually conducts interviews, asking questions and
  making notes about each candidate
. Decision phase - after interviewing all candidates, the interviewer summarises his/her opinions, refers
  to the remarks he/she made of each interviewee and decides who to select

These 3 phases are clearly defined in HireLah!. What you can do in each phase is listed below.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `<angular brackets>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add interviewee <full name>`, `<full name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add interviewee John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `<full name> [-aka <alias>]` can be used as `John Doe -aka Jo` or as `John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times, unless otherwise stated e.g. `[-a <attribute> -w <weight>]...` can be used as, `-a ambition -w 0.5`, `-a ambition -w 0.5 -a teamwork -w 0.1` etc.
====

=== Start Session

HireLah! takes care of this for you! By default, the first time you use HireLah!, the app will create a new folder
`/data` in the same directory as the app and save your session data there. To learn how to configure your interview
sessions (starting a fresh session, renaming your session, changing sessions) refer to <<FAQ>>.

=== Viewing help

*Command*

`help`

_Action:_ This user guide is opened as a PDF with your system's default PDF viewer.

=== Initialization Phase

// tag::interviewees[]
==== Add, Edit and Delete Interviewees

HireLah! allows you to manage your list of candidates from within the app. You can add interviewees to the list
by giving their full name, and HireLah! automatically generates a unique ID for each candidate. To make things easier,
you can also specify an alias (a shorter name) to the interviewee, so you need not memorise their IDs or type out their
full names every time.

Whenever you see `<interviewee>`, it means that you can specify the interviewee you are referring to via any of his/her
unique identifiers - ID, full name or alias.

At any time you can delete any interviewees and edit their information.

[TIP]
Most names and aliases are accepted - even non-English names or names with funny punctuation and numbers (eg. Larry O'Brien the 3rd).
Your interviewees could come from anywhere after all. But do not give blanks or a name full of numbers (eg. 12345)!

*Commands*

....
add interviewee <interviewee> [-aka <alias>]
edit interviewee <interviewee> [-n <new full name>] [-aka <new alias>]
delete interviewee <interviewee>
....

*Execution Example*

....
> add interviewee Jane Doe -aka Doe
> edit interviewee Jane Doe -n Janice Doe -aka JDoe
> delete interviewee Janice Doe
....

_Action:_ Interviewee Jane Doe with alias of Doe is first created and
then her name is changed to Janice Doe.

_Output:_

....
New interviewee added: Jane Doe

Edited interviewee: Jane Doe

Deleted interviewee: Janice Doe
....

==== Add, Edit and Delete Attributes

In an interview, you often look out for a particular set of attributes in your candidates.
HireLah! lets you keep track of what to look out for during the interview, and even assign
scores for each attribute to the interviewees so you can compare them after interviewing.

[TIP]
An attribute's name can only contain alphabets and spaces, and it should not be blank!

*Command*

....
> add attribute <attribute>
> edit attribute <old attribute> -a <new attribute>
> delete attribute <attribute>
....

*Execution Example*

....
> add attribute teamwork
> add attribute leadersip
> edit attribute leadersip -a leadership
> delete attribute teamwork
....

_Action:_ teamwork and leadersip is first added. leadersip (with a typo) is edited
to leadership, and then teamwork is deleted.

_Output:_

....
New attribute added: teamwork

New attribute added: leadersip

Edited attribute: leadersip to leadership

Deleted attribute: teamwork
....

// end::attributes[]

// tag::questions[]
==== Add, Edit and Delete Interview Questions

Before the interview process, the interviewer may one to review the
questions. During review process, the interviewer may wants to add more
questions, remove the unnecessary questions and to edit the existing
questions.

*Command*

....
add question <question description>
edit question <question number> -q <edited question>
delete question <question number>
....

*Example*

....
> add question What are your relevant experiences?
> add question What are your strengths?
> edit question 1 -q What do you hope to accomplish in 5 years?
> edit question 2 -q How can you add value to the company?
> delete question 1
....

_Action:_ A question "What are your relevant experiences?" will be added.
Then, question 1 and 2 will be edited, before question 1 is deleted.

_Output:_

....
New question added: What are your relevant experiences?

New question added: What are your strengths?

Edited question 1 to What do you hope to accomplish in 5 years?

Edited question 2 to How can you add value to the company?

Deleted question: What do you hope to accomplish in 5 years?
....

// end::questions[]

==== Switching views

When working on the interviewees, attributes, questions and metrics (more about metrics in <<Metrics>>),
HireLah! displays the relevant content you are working on. To switch views, HireLah! also provides the list commands.

*Command*

....
list interviewee
list attribute
list question
list metric
....

_Action:_ Switches between displaying interviewees, attributes, questions and metrics.

_Output:_

....

==== Finalise Interview Attributes and Questions

After the interviewer is satisfied with the list of questions and attributes created for an interview session, the interviewer must finalise changes in attributes and questions. This is to ensure that the interviewers will evaluate all interviewees fairly and equally using the same set of questions and attributes.

*Command*

....
finalise
....

_Output:_

....
Attributes and questions of this interview session has been finalised. You cannot change them anymore.
....

....

image::Screenshots/Remark.png[]

==== Asking Questions

Special commands while interviewing are prefixed with a ":". These commands are
not recorded as remarks and instead perform special actions.

The start question command allows you to indicate when you asked a question during
the interview. This allows you to easily navigate to relevant parts of the interview
after the interview ends, while viewing the report.

*Command*

....
:start q<question number>
....

*Example*

....
> :start q1
> Strengths: resilience, ambitious, good time-management

image::Screenshots/StartQuestion.png[]

==== Score attributes

During the interview, as you form your opinion on the candidate, you can give them scores for the
attributes you have created earlier (see <<Attributes>>).

*Command*

....
:<attribute> <score>
....

*Example*

....
> :leadership 5
....

_Action:_ update the Leadership score for John Doe (displayed on a bar chart).

==== End interview

After finishing the interview, give the end command. After the interview has ended,
you will not be allowed to make any more remarks or change the interviewee's scores.
Don't end prematurely!

[TIP]
HireLah! will not allow you to end the interview if you have not assigned a score
on all the attributes!

*Command*

....
:end
....

*Example*

....
> end
....

_Action:_ Ending the interview session.

_Output_:

....
Ended interview with John Doe.
....

image::Screenshots/EndInterview.png[]

=== Decision Phase

[[Metrics]]
// tag::metrics[]
==== Add, Edit and Delete Metrics

After the interview process, the interviewer may want to compare the interviewed interviewees by
creating a custom metric to determine the relative importance of several attributes. Each metric
assigns a weight to one or more Attributes, and interviewees can be ranked based on their score calculated by
this metric via the `best` command (see <<Find Best Candidates>>.

[TIP]
A metric's name can only contain alphabets and spaces, and it should not be blank!

*Command*

....
add metric <name> -a <attribute> -w <score> [-a <attribute> -w <score>]...
edit metric <name> [-n <metric name>] [-a <attribute> -w <score>]...
delete metric <name>
....

*Example*

....
> add metric extremeLeader -a leadership -w 0.7 -a tenacity -w 0.6
> edit metric extremeLeader -n extremeDictatorship -a leadership -w 3
> delete metric extremeDictatorship
> add metric extremeLeader -a leadership -w 0.7 -a tenacity -w 0.3
....

_Action:_ Adds a metric named extremeLeader with the scoring scheme
_Score = 0.7*leadership + 0.6*tenacity_. Then, the extremeLeader metric
name will be changed to extremeDictatorship with the weightage of leadership increased to 3.
Next it deletes extremeDictatorship, then adds the metric extremeLeader (again) with
a different scoring scheme _Score = 0.7*leadership + 0.3*tenacity_.

_Output:_

....
New metric added: extremeLeader

Edited metric: extremeLeader

Deleted metric: extremeDictatorship

New metric added: extremeLeader
....

// end::metrics[]

// tag::report[]
==== Viewing Interviewee Reports

After interviewing a candidate, you can view the interview transcript any
time by doing an open command. To close the report, simply just switch to another view
via the list commands (see <<Switching views>>) or open another person's report.

*Command*

....
open <interviewee>
....

*Example*

....
> open Jane Doe
....

_Action_: Shows the entire list of remarks made during the interview, with
their timestamps.

_Output_:

....
Successfully opened Interviewee report: Jane Doe
....

image::Screenshots/Report.png[]
// end::report[]

// tag::navigation[]
==== Working in an Interviewee Report

After opening a report, you can scroll up and down to navigate through
the remarks you made during the interview. In addition, you can zoom in
on a particular moment in the interview by question number, or by the
interview time.

===== Navigating by Question Number

Jumps to the point when the interviewee was
answering the given question (marked by the `:start q<question number>` command.

*Command*

....
goto q<question number>
....

*Example*

....
> goto q2
....

_Output_:

....
Here is the remark of question 2!
....

image::Screenshots/NavigationQuestion.png[]

===== Navigating by Timestamp

Scrolls the list of remarks to the given time.
The user can scroll up and down to see the rest of the remarks.

*Command*

....
goto <time>
....

*Example*

....
> goto 1.00
....

_Output_:

....
Here is the remark at time 1.00!
....

image::Screenshots/NavigationTime.png[]
// end::navigation[]

// tag::best[]
==== Find Best Candidates

After interviewing all the candidates, HireLah! can help you analyse the candidates and show
you who scored the best in the attributes you set. By default, HireLah! allows you to compare by

. The candidates' average scores across all attributes
. A single attribute (eg. find who scored the highest in leadership)

However you can also specify your own custom scoring metric (see <<Metrics>>).

[TIP]
Take note that HireLah! will only compare interviewees who have completed their interviews
(Those who you have successfully performed an `:end` command after interviewing). This is
to make sure all the compared candidates have been scored in all attributes.

[TIP]
In case there are ties in terms of the score, e.g. if we would like to retrieve the best 5 interviewees,
but the score between the fifth and the sixth interviewees, both interviewees will be shown.

*Command*

....
best <number of candidates>
best <number of candidates> [-a <attribute>]
best <number of candidates> [-m <metric>]
....

*Example*

....
best 1
best 2 -m extremeLeader
best 3 -a leadership
....

_Action_: Firstly, HireLah! will show top 1 interviewees in overall score.
Then, it will show the top 2 interviewees based on their leadership score. Finally, it will
show the top 3 interviewees based on the extremeDictatorship metric.

_Output_:

....
Here are the best 1 interviewees.

Here are the best 2 interviewees.

Here are the best 3 interviewees.
....

// end::best[]

== Advanced Features

=== Typing shortcuts - Prefix matching

It is often tedious to have to type out a long attribute like "Productivity"
or "Team Player". Especially during an interview, a typing mistake may cost you
precious time, possibly missing some important thing the interviewee said. HireLah!
thus allows you to simply type part (a prefix) of the full word, as long as it
uniquely identifies an attribute.

For example, if you have the following attributes

* Leadership
* Ambition
* Team player
* Team motivator

Then

* "L", "Le" or any longer prefix can uniquely identify "Leadership"
* "A" sufficiently identifies "Ambition"
* "Team" **cannot** identify "Team player" as "Team motivator" shares this prefix
* To minimally distinguish the 2, you must provide "Team p" or "Team m"

HireLah! also provides this convenient function for other things that require
typing names, such as the metric names. Questions are referenced by their question number
and interviewees can use their interviewee ID, and a short alias can be given so the feature is not provided.

// tag::gui[]
=== GUI Convenience Features

==== Accessing Interviewee Report

It might be tedious opening an interviewee's reports via the Command Line Interface command
`open <interviewee>`. As such, we have implemented a convenient way of accessing interviewee reports.

In order to open the report of an interviewee, the user can simply navigate view the interviewees, and click on the card of the interviewee the user want to view.

==== Accessing Interviewee Resume

During an interview or while viewing the interview report of an interviewee, the user can open the interviewee's resume easily by clicking on the "View Resume" button. If no resume has been uploaded for the interviewee, the button will say "No Resume" instead.

image::Screenshots/OpenResumeGUI.png[width="400"]

=== Keeping Track of Interview Questions

The user may wish to refer to the list of interview questions created during an interview. As such, a second window showing the list of questions will pop up when the interviewer starts an interview.

image::Screenshots/QuestionListInterview.png[width="300"]
// end::gui[]

== FAQ

Q: After an interview session for a role is finished, how do I start a fresh session? +
A: In the home directory of HireLah! After the first time the app is run, a
file called `preferences.json` will be created by the app to save your preferences, including
the file where the session data is saved. Simply change the "sessionsDirectory" field to a new
directory (with a relative path to the home directory), or just change the name and let HireLah!
create the new directory for you!

Sample `preferences.json`:
....
{
  "guiSettings" : {
    "windowWidth" : 1382.0,
    "windowHeight" : 744.0,
    "windowCoordinates" : {
      "x" : -8,
      "y" : -8
    }
  },
  "sessionsDirectory" : "data"
}
....
After changing the session directory:
....
{
  "guiSettings" : {
    "windowWidth" : 1382.0,
    "windowHeight" : 744.0,
    "windowCoordinates" : {
      "x" : -8,
      "y" : -8
    }
  },
  "sessionsDirectory" : "ceo-interview"
}
....
Now HireLah! will start in an empty session called ceo-interview. To switch
between multiple sessions, just change the sessionDirectory to the correct directory.

Q: What happens if the app crashes halfway? Especially during an interview? +
A: HireLah! saves your work after every change. If the app crashes during an interview,
the next time you open the app, the interviewee you were interviewing will be in
an "incomplete interview" state. You can simply resume the interview by calling
the `interview <interviewee>` command again. Note that you cannot perform the usual
decision phase commands (finding best interviewee, viewing report) on an interviewee whose
interview is incomplete!
