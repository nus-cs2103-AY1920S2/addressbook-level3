[[GUI]]
== Interpreting Calgo's Graphical User Interface +

(by Janice) +

//placeholder unlabelled image
.A labelled illustration of Calgo on startup
[reftext="Figure 4.1"]
[caption = "Figure 4.1: "]
image::UiLabelled.png[]

Calgo's GUI is designed to be sleek and compact, allowing you to use and view all of Calgo's features on a single window.
However, that might be a little overwhelming at the start. Hence,
this section aims to give a rundown on the GUI's various parts and ease you into using the App, starting from the
top of the GUI shown in the above diagram.

These sections are labelled from 1 to 8, in the following order:

. `Menu Bar`
. `Command Box`
. `Result Display`
. `Daily Goal Display`
. `Consumption Record`
. `Graph Display`
. `Food Record`
. `Status Bar`

There is  a ninth part, the `Help Window`, that is a separate pop up - only appearing when required for your convenience.

<<<
=== `Menu Bar`
The bar has two buttons, `File` and `Help`. The buttons allow
you to exit the App by clicking the exit option under `File`, and to access the command guide by clicking the
 help option under `Help`. These buttons are there for your convenience, as exiting the app can also be done through the
`exit` command. Likewise, accessing the command guides can be done using the `help` command.

=== `Command Box`
Calgo listens to your requests and processes them. The `Command Box` is where you type commands into.

[[TIP]]
Should you mistype a command, Calgo will prompt you to use the right format. You can easily edit the wrong command
inside the `Command Box` without needing to retype it entirely.

=== `Result Display`
This is where Calgo displays textual updates as a result of processing your inputted commands. The `Result Display` will
always show a response so you will know whether your commands have been correctly processed.

=== `Daily Goal Consumption`
This section is labelled "Your Goal Information" on the GUI, and consists of two parts. The left box
displays your target daily calorie goal (after you've set it using the `goal` command). The right box shows
the amount of calories you still need to consume to meet your daily goal, or the amount you've exceeded by.

The `Daily Goal Consumption` updates automatically.

=== `Consumption Record`
The `Consumption Record` displays the list of `Food` entries that you have consumed on that day. Although it only shows
one day's consumption, the `stomach` command lets you view other days' records.

It has three subsections:

. The name of the `Food` entry.
. The number of portions of the `Food` you consumed that day.
. The average rating as set by you, color-coded from red to green for low to high rating.

<<<
=== `Graph Display`
This section contains a graph that shows a summary of your past seven day's total calorie consumption. It displays data
starting from the date of the current `Consumption Record`.

Example: `Consumption Record` currently shows 2020-04-12. `Graph Display` will thus show the daily calories consumed from
2020-04-06 to 2020-04-12.

=== `Food Record`
This is a list of all `Food` entries you currently have in Calgo. Each `Food` entry will have a name, its nutritional
information, and optional tags as set by you. The `Food Record` alternates colors between entries so that you
can easily tell one entry apart from its neighbours.

=== `Status Bar`
This bar shows where Calgo reads system data from. You should not delete or modify these files.
//end::interpretGUI[]

<<<
[[Commands]]
== Commands

In this section, specific information about each command will be explained. This includes the purpose of each command,
how it is formatted and visual examples of its usage.

Before we begin, do take note of the following information which applies to all Calgo commands:
====
*Command Format Information*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters that you should provide.
** *Example:* In `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter. `n/kiwi` would mean that the name of the `Food` is 'kiwi'.
* Parameters in square brackets (i.e. []) are optional.
** *Example:* In `[t/TAG]`, `TAG` is an optional parameter which can be used as `t/fruit` to tag the `Food` as a 'fruit'.
* Parameters can be given in any order, as long as the correct prefix appears before the parameter.
** *Example:* If a command specifies `n/NAME p/PROTEIN`, then entering `p/PROTEIN n/NAME` also gives the same functionality.
* Parameters with ellipses (`…`)​ after them can be used zero or more times.
** *Example:* For `[t/TAG]...` the following are valid:

- Leaving the parameter empty.
- Typing `t/favourite` with one tag.
- Typing `t/favourite t/green` with two tags.
- Typing with more than 2 tags.
====

TIP: As you key in the name of the `Food` for any of the following commands: `update`, `delete`, or `nom`, the `Result Display`
will show suggestions for `Food` entries based on what you have typed.
Never make spelling mistakes again!

The following subsections will elaborate on the specific details of Calgo commands.


<<<
// tag::clearCommandUG[]
=== `clear` : Clearing all entries
(by Vineeth)

If you want to clear all the `Food` entries currently stored in your `Food Record`, this command will be useful to you.

[NOTE]
The data in your `Consumption Record` and `Graph Display` will not be affected from executing the `clear` command.

[NOTE]
To cater to fast typists who are more likely to make typing mistakes, Calgo will still execute this command even if there are
other parameters or words that are typed after `clear`. +

Format: `clear` +

Example:

Suppose that you want to drastically improve your diet. You decide to take a look at all of your `Food` entries
currently in the `Food Record` but realise none of them fit into your new diet.
To avoid the hassle of deleting each `Food` entry one by one, you decide to `clear` them. This is what you need to do:

image::ClearCommandBefore.png[]

First, type `clear` and then press kbd:[enter], as shown in the above diagram.

image::ClearCommandAfter.png[]

Upon entering the command, all your `Food` entries in the  `Food Record` will be deleted. This will result in an empty `Food Record`, as shown above.
As mentioned previously, your data in the `Consumption Record` and `Graph Display` is left unchanged.

// end::clearCommandUG[]

<<<

// tag::deletecommand[]

=== `delete` : Deleting a `Food` from current `Food Record`
(by Zhang Xian)

If you no longer require Calgo to store a particular `Food` and its nutritional values for you, you can use the `delete` command
to remove the specified `Food` from your `Food Record`.

[NOTE]
The `Food` that you wish to `delete` must already exist in the current `Food Record`.
[TIP]
For your convenience, the `NAME` field of your input for the `delete` command is case insensitive. Therefore, `n/Pizza`
and `n/pizza` are treated by Calgo as the same `Food`.

Format: `delete n/NAME`

Example:

Say you want to remove a `Food`, `Pizza`, that already exists in your `Food Record`. This is how you can do it:

image::DeleteCommandBefore.png[]

You should first enter `delete n/pizza` as input, and press kbd:[enter]. Note that `delete n/Pizza` also has the same effect.

image::DeleteCommandAfter.png[]

Once the command has been entered, the `Result Display` shows the results of your command and the `Food Record` no longer shows
a `Food` entry for `Pizza`.

// end::deletecommand[]

=== `exit`: Closing Calgo

If you want to exit the App, you can use the `exit` command.

[NOTE]
All your data is automatically saved upon
exiting Calgo.

Format: `exit`

<<<
// tag::exportfoodrecord[]
=== `export` : Exporting the current `Food Record` into a reference sheet
(by Eugene) +

Obtaining a portable copy of the current `Food Record` may be useful for various purposes. For instance, you can
conveniently share your `Food` entries with friends, print the `Food Record` for future reference, or even adapt it to
suit your personal cooking needs in the kitchen. Whatever the purpose, we have you covered with the `export` command. +

The `export` command provides you with a neatly formatted, editable file that reflects all entries in the current `Food Record`.
This file (named FoodRecord.txt) will be created in the `data/exports` folder. +

Here are some key pointers for using the command:
****
* FoodRecord.txt shows the `Food Record` in alphabetical order of `Food` names, and includes the corresponding details
of each `Food` neatly in a table.
* If a previous FoodRecord.txt file exists, do close any instances of the file (if previously opened) before running the
 `export` command. The file will be replaced by an updated version representing your latest `Food Record`.
* Tags are placed outside of the dashed lines.
****

[TIP]
This lets you manually track your diet using a reference sheet of your past `Food` entries. You can freely edit this
reference sheet to include information outside of Calgo. +
[NOTE]
Certain `Food` names may be too long to fit into the given space. Such names will be shown on multiple lines.
However, rest assured that all your information is still captured and neatly organised.
Individual entries will also appear on separate lines.

Format: `export` +
(any parameters entered are ignored)

<<<
Example: +

Let's suppose you wish to export the current `Food Record` so that you can print a copy for reference while cooking. Here's how you can do it:

image::ExportCommandBefore.png[]

You should type in the command and press kbd:[enter], as seen above.

image::ExportCommandAfter.png[]

Doing so, Calgo  will show you a result message indicating the copy has been successfully generated.
You can find this copy (named FoodRecord.txt) in the `data/exports` folder.
// end::exportfoodrecord[]

<<<
// tag::findcommand[]
[[FindCommand]]
=== `find` : Finding a `Food` entry by nutritional value or keyword(s)
(by Eugene) +

When you have many entries in the `Food Record`, it may be rather difficult to search for a particular one.
This is where the `find` command comes in nicely.

The `find` command shows all `Food` entries that have a nutritional value matching what you specify. This can be the
number of calories, or the number of grams of protein, carbohydrate or fat.

Alternatively, you can choose to search for a keyword which appears in any part of the name or in one of the tags
associated with a particular `Food` entry.

Here are some key pointers:
****
* The `find` command takes in one, and only one parameter.
* For finding via nutritional value, only `Food` entries with the same value will be shown.
* You don't have to capitalise keywords. The search is always case insensitive when searching for keyword(s) via name or tag. +
* You don't actually have to type out the entire keyword either. For your convenience, incomplete keywords will be matched
to `Food` entries containing them in any part of the specified parameter of name or tag. +
* You can search for multiple name keywords by using a single `n/` `Prefix`, separating them with space(s). +
****

[NOTE]
If you're a fast typist, fear not! We understand the possibility that typing errors can be made quite often, so any
additional input for the `find` command without a preceding `Prefix` (e.g. `n/`, `p/`) will be ignored.

[TIP]
The `Food Record` displays the relevant entries of each `find` command. We can reset the `Food Record` to show all
entries once again using the <<ListCommand, `list`>> command.

Format: `find [n/NAME] [cal/CALORIES] [p/PROTEINS] [c/CARBOHYDRATES] [f/FATS] [t/TAG]` +
(Reminder: choose only 1 parameter)

Examples: +

Example 1: Say you want to use Calgo to search for a `Food` entry with 150 calories because you are
looking for a light snack. Here is how you can do it:

image::FindCommandCalorieBefore.png[]

You should type `find cal/150`, then press kbd:[enter]. +

image::FindCommandCalorieAfter.png[]
Once the command has been entered, the `Result Display` shows the results of your command and the `Food Record`
displays the relevant entries with 150 calories.

<<<

Example 2: Say you wish to find entries which contain the keyword `Cheese` in their name, but your hand slipped and
the keyboard only typed `Chees`. This is what happens: +

image::FindCommandSubstringBefore.png[]

You are likely to enter `find n/Chees` as the command input. +

image::FindCommandSubstringAfter.png[]

Once the command has been entered, the `Result Display` shows the results of your command and the `Food Record` shows
the relevant entries which contain `Chees` in their name. This is not too bad, as you still obtain entries that will
be largely relevant to `Cheese`. This shows that the `find` command can search for `Food` entries
with incomplete keywords.

<<<

Example 3: Say you are lazy but wish to find entries containing the keyword `sweet` in their tag. Here is how you can do it: +

image::FindCommandTagBefore.png[]

You can type `find t/swe` as input, and then press kbd:[enter]. +

image::FindCommandTagAfter.png[]

Upon entering the command, the `Food Record` will display all entries which have the `swe` keyword present in any one of
their tags. As you can search using incomplete keywords, the intended search for the `sweet` tag will also have its result shown. +

Please note that the search is case-insensitive, an example being the resulting `Sweet` tag of `Bandung`. Moreover,
as with Example 2, we allow for incomplete words to be used as search keywords.
// end::findcommand[]

<<<

//tag::goalCommandUG[]
[[goal]]
=== `goal` : Setting a daily calorie target
(by Vineeth)

A healthy lifestyle is not achieved overnight. Calgo understands the importance of keeping the end in mind with regards to achieving your healthy lifestyle.
Thus, to motivate you to put in consistent effort, you can set daily calorie goals for yourself using the `goal` command.

Here are some key pointers:

****
* The goal that you set will be used to generate insights in your consumption report. For more information related to that, you check out the `report` command <<report, here>>.

* After setting a daily calorie goal, you can still change it whenever you want to. All Calgo insights will subsequently update so that they are based on your most current goal.


****

[NOTE]

Acceptable values are positive integers, ranging from 1 to 99999.

Format: `goal GOAL`

<<<

Example:

Let's suppose you are a young adult who is trying to lose weight because your favourite jeans have become too tight.
You search online for the ideal number of calorie you should consume daily to lose weight. A credible online source states
it should be 1900 calories. Now, you want to reflect that daily calorie goal in Calgo. You can do that by following this simple step:

image::GoalCommandBefore.png[]

Type in `goal 1900` and press kbd:[enter], as shown above. +

<<<

image::GoalCommandAfter.png[]

As you can see, the `Daily Goal Display` has updated to reflect your daily calorie goal. You can now track your meals
and get immediate updates on the remaining amount of calories you have to consume for that day to achieve your goal.

//end::goalCommandUG[]

// tag::helpCommand[]
=== `help` : Displaying `help` when lost

(by Janice)

Whether you are an experienced Calgo user or a newcomer to the App, it can be hard to remember what a command's usage and format
is. Thus, the `help` command aims to remind you of them.

Here are some key pointers:

****
* The `help` command displays all available commands, in alphabetical order.
* If you want to find out more about a specific command, `help` can used with a keyword.
- This keyword is the name of the command you want to know more about.
****

Format: `help [COMMAND_WORD]`

<<<

Example:

Let's say you've forgotten how to add `Food` entries to your `Consumption Record`. You know there is a command called `nom`,
but don't recall its format. You can use the `help` command to obtain the format like so:

image::HelpCommandBefore.png[]

Type `help`, then press kbd:[enter].

image::HelpCommandPopup.png[]

This creates a popup (the `Help Window`) with command guides. However that displays all the commands, which might make searching for only
`nom` a bit daunting. Instead, you can type `help nom`, then press kbd:[enter].

image::HelpCommandWithNomBefore.png[]

As you can see, the `Help Window` popup now only shows the command guide for `nom`.

image::HelpCommandWithNomPopup.png[]
// end::helpCommand[]

<<<

// tag::listcommand[]
[[ListCommand]]
=== `list` : Listing all `Food` in current `Food Record`
(by Eugene) +

With a large number of entries in the `Food Record`, you may remember that we can use the <<FindCommand, `find`>>
command to display only the relevant `Food` entries. Once we are done with the search, we will eventually want to
view all entries again. This is where the `list` command comes in handy. +

The `list` command resets the display accordingly to show all entries in the `Food Record`. These entries will be neatly sorted,
just as the `Food Record` previously appeared:
****
* All entries will appear in lexicographical order.
* `Food` entries will once again be listed with all their corresponding details.
****

[TIP]
You can think of this as the reverse of a <<FindCommand, `find`>> command.
After a `find` command, you are advised to complete your intended actions first, before using the `list` command to
reset the display. This allows for a smoother workflow as you will now avoid the need to perform the same `find` command again.

Format: `list` +
(any parameters entered are ignored)

<<<

Example:

Let's say you want to view all entries again after performing a `find n/Chicken` command. You can do the following:

image::ListCommandBefore.png[]

Type `list` as input, then press kbd:[enter].

image::ListCommandAfter.png[]

The `Result Display` will then indicate the result of your command, and the `Food Record` will now show all `Food` entries once again.
// end::listcommand[]

<<<

=== `nom` : Adding `Food` to `Consumption Record`
(by Ruicong)

Your `Consumption Record` stores everything that you have consumed.
With the `nom` command, you can add `Food` that you have consumed on a certain day to your
`Consumption Record`. +

The `nom` command helps you to keep track of your consumption on certain date. +

Below is some information to keep in mind:
****
* The `Food` you consume should exist in `Food Record`.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
* The `nom` command has some default behavior when you choose to not provide values for certain `Prefixes`. Do note that
this is not the same as excluding optional parameters.
* The following are the default behaviors:
- If you do not provide the date, or if its `Prefix` does not have a value,
Calgo will by default take it that you consumed the `Food` today.
- If you do not provide the portion, or if its `Prefix` does not have a value,
Calgo will by default take it that you consumed 1 portion of `Food`.
- If you do not provide the rating, the consumption of `Food` will not have a rating associated with it.
However, if you do not give the `Prefix` a value, you will get an error.
* The rating for a `Food` displayed is based on the average rating given to the `Food` on that day.
****

[TIP]
As you enter `nom n/..`, Calgo will show you `Food` suggestions that match what you are searching for in the `Result Display`.
Names in Calgo are case insensitive, so you can type quickly without worrying about the specific name of the `Food`.
[TIP]
If you have planned to eat something at a future date, you can use `nom` to record a consumption
with a date that comes after today.

Format: `nom n/NAME [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION][r/RATING]`

<<<

Example:

Suppose you want to have a Cheeseburger today and have already stored its nutritional content
in `Food Record`. Since you just want to dig in as soon as possible, yet still want to jot your meal down,
you decide to enter the simplest command possible. Here's how you do it:

image::NomCommandBefore.png[]

First, enter `nom n/Cheeseburger` as input and press kbd:[enter].

image::NomCommandAfter.png[]

Once you enter the command, the `Result Display` will inform you that the food has been consumed.
The `Consumption Record` panel and `Graph Display` are updated to reflect your latest consumption.

<<<
//tag::reportCommandUG[]
[[report]]
=== `report` : Generating key statistics and insights
(by Vineeth)

Why stop at keeping track of your meals? Go a step further and use your past consumption patterns
to learn how to improve your eating habits. Moreover, won't it be convenient if you can automatically generate tips on how to improve?
This is exactly what the `report` command can help you with!

Given a date, the `report` command analyses your consumption pattern in that day to generate relevant statistics and
helpful insights for improving your diet. You no longer have to tediously calculate the total amount of calories you consumed in a day. Calgo does it for you, instantly!

[NOTE]
The document generated by the `report` command is stored in the `data/reports` folder. This document is named after the given date in this format: yyyy-mm-dd_report.txt. For instance, if you generate a report on 27th of April 2020, the generated document is 2020-04-27_report.txt.

[TIP]
To generate more insightful suggestions, do set a daily calorie goal before generating the report. To learn how to do that,
check out the `goal` command <<goal, here>>.

Refer to the list below for the various types of insights that you can easily obtain from the `report` command.
****

* All `Food` consumed on the given date. For each `Food` entry, the following information will be included:
** The name of the `Food`.
** Quantity consumed. For instance, 1.5 portions.
** Number of calories consumed.

* The total number of calories consumed in that day.
* The total number of grams of protein, carbohydrate and fat consumed on that day.
* Insights on whether you have achieved your goal.
* Insights on what your favourite `Food` is and whether it should continue to be in your diet.
****

<<<

Format: `report d/DATE`

[NOTE]
When entering the `report` command, do note there is a default behaviour for the `DATE` prefix. If you do not provide the date, or if its `Prefix` does not have a value,
Calgo will by default take it that you intend to generate a report based on today's date.



Example:

Let's suppose you had a buffet on 27th of April 2020 and you managed to `nom` lots of exciting `Food` into your
`Consumption Record`. It is now the end of the day and you want to look back and find out how you fared. This is what you can do:

image::ReportCommandBefore.png[]

First, type `report d/2020-04-27` and press kbd:[enter], as shown above.

<<<

image::SampleReport.png[]

Second, go to the `data/reports` folder and open 2020-04-27_report.txt. You will
see a report that looks similar to the one in the above screenshot.

<<<

The following steps breakdown what information is included in each section of the report.

image::ReportHeader.png[]

The first section is the `Report Header`, which states the date of your consumption pattern that is being analysed in the report. In this case,
your food consumption pattern on the 27th of April 2020 is analysed in the displayed report screenshot.

image::ReportGoalInfo.png[]

The second section is `Your Goal Information`. This section reminds you of the daily calorie goal that you have set for yourself.

image::ReportFoodwiseStatistics.png[]

The third section is `Food-wise Statistics`. As the name suggests, this section provides you with relevant statistics for every `Food` entry in your `Consumption Record` of the given day.
In this case, you can see a variety of `Food` entries that you have tracked from your buffet experience. For each `Food` entry, the report displays the name of the `Food`, the total number of portions you consumed and the total amount of calories from that `Food`.
You can use this information to realise what `Food` you may be over-consuming.

<<<

image::ReportAggregateStatistics.png[]

The fourth section is `Aggregate Statistics`, which shows you the total amount of calories, protein, carbohydrates and fat that you have consumed on the given day.
This section could be particularly helpful if you are interested in tracking your total nutritional intake each day.

image::ReportInsights.png[]

The fifth section is called `Insights for You`. In this section, Calgo uses your daily calorie goal to explain how close you were to achieving it.
For you to continually improve your eating habits, Calgo, like any other friend, pushes you with motivating messages and congratulates you if you achieved the goal.
In this case, as you exceeded the daily calorie goal by 959 calories, Calgo provides you with some reassurance that you can do better the next day to ensure that you do not give up.

<<<

image::ReportSuggestions.png[]



The penultimate section is `Suggestions for You`. In this section, Calgo analyses your `Consumption Record` of the past week from the given date to find out what you can do to improve your eating habits.
Calgo does this by using a mix of your ratings and quantity consumed of each `Food` to intelligently infer what your favourite `Food` is. It then analyses if you can continue to keep your favourite `Food` in the past week in your diet based on your daily calorie goal.
Over time, through Calgo's smart suggestions, you will eventually have a diet consisting of your favourite `Food` entries that are compatible with your goal. How awesome is that!

image::ReportFooter.png[]

The final section is the `Report Footer`, which informs you that the report has concluded. This is the part where you realise that Calgo provides you with so many key insights in such a neatly organised and compact document.

=== `stomach` : Showing all `Food` consumed on a particular day
(by Ruicong)

Do you find it a hassle to constantly recall what you ate? Can't seem to remember what you had for lunch last week? +

You can now remember everything, because Calgo remembers for you. The `stomach` command displays all of the `Food` you ate on a
particular day, showing it in the `Consumption Record`.

[tip]
For a more detailed statistical report with nutritional values of `Food` consumed, you can refer to
the section on the `report` command <<report, here>>.

Here are some key pointers:

* Calgo uses today's date by default if no value is given for its `Prefix`.
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
****

Format: `stomach [d/DATE]`

<<<

Example: If you want to see what you have consumed on 12 April 2020, here's how you can do it:

image::StomachCommandBefore.png[]

Type the command `stomach d/2020-04-12` as input and press kbd:[enter].

image::StomachCommandAfter.png[]

The `Consumption Record` will display all the `Food` you have consumed on 12 April 2020.
You can also see that `Daily Goal Display` has updated to show the amount of calories you have consumed on 12 April 2020,
relative to your daily goal.

=== `update` : Updating Calgo's `Food Record`
(by Zhang Xian)

Tired of searching for nutritional information online for the same food repeatedly? Frustrated of having no convenient place to note it down?

The `update` command allows you to enter new `Food` entries into Calgo's `Food Record`. Moreover, as a smart feature, Calgo detects if
there is an existing `Food` entry with the same name. If so, it will edit that `Food` entry with new information provided by you.

Here are some key pointers:
****
* All of Calgo's `Food` entries have unique names.
* Calgo automatically formats name inputs to proper case. Therefore it does not matter whether you input a name in
upper or lower case.
- For instance, updating a `Food` with name `chicken nugget spicy` will result in the `Food` being saved as `Chicken Nugget Spicy` in the `Food Record`
****

[TIP]
We suggest you to be as specific as possible in naming your `Food`.
Instead of naming your `Food` "Chocolate", perhaps "White Chocolate" or "Dark Chocolate" would be a better idea.

Format: `update n/NAME cal/CALORIES p/PROTEINS c/CARBOHYDRATES f/FATS [t/TAGS]`

<<<

Examples:

Example 1: Suppose you want to create a `Food` entry for Mee Goreng in Calgo. After searching online for the
nutritional values for Mee Goreng, you found that Mee Goreng has 418 calories, 8g of protein, 58g of carbohydrate and 17g of fat.
Here's how you update your new `Food`, Mee Goreng, into your `Food Record`:

image::UpdateCommandNewBefore.png[]

You should type `update n/Mee Goreng cal/418 p/8 c/58 f/17` and press kbd:[enter].

<<<

image::UpdateCommandNewAfter.png[]

Once the command has been entered, the `Result Display` shows the result of your command and the `Food Record` has been updated with a new `Food`, Mee Goreng.

Example 2: Perhaps you realised that there was an error with the nutritional values keyed in for an existing `Food`, Mee Goreng, inside your `Food Record`.
You wish to `update` the protein value for Mee Goreng to a new value of 10g. This is how you can do it:

image::UpdateCommandExistingFoodBefore.png[]

Type `update n/Mee Goreng cal/418 p/10 c/58 f/17` as input and press kbd:[enter].

<<<

image::UpdateCommandExistingFoodAfter.png[]

Once the command has been entered, the `Result Display` shows the result of your command and the `Food`, Mee Goreng, in
`Food Record` has been updated with a new protein nutritional value of 10g.

Example 3: Suppose you want to `update` a new `Food`, Char Kuay Teow, into the `Food Record`. However, you typed the
name of the `Food` in hurry and did not capitalise some letters properly.
Instead of "Char Kuay Teow", you accidentally typed "char KUay TeoW" in the name field. You can do this:

image::UpdateCommandCapitaliseBefore.png[]

You can then type `update n/char KUay TeoW cal/200 p/20 c/22 f/30 t/greasy` and press kbd:[enter].

<<<

image::UpdateCommandCapitaliseAfter.png[]

Calgo automatically formats the name of your `Food` for you to proper case. Hence, you
see that instead of a hideous "char KUay TeoW"
being updated into the `Food Record`, your new `Food` item is updated as "Char Kuay Teow".

=== `vomit` : Removing portions of `Food` from `Consumption Record`
(by Ruicong)

If you have overstated an amount previously (or actually vomited from over-consumption), you can amend existing
consumption records using the `vomit` command.

[NOTE]
The `Food` that you wish to `vomit` must already exist in the current `Consumption Record`,
but not necessarily exist in the `Food Record`.

****
* The `vomit` command deletes a portion of food at the specified index. This index refers to the position of `Food` shown in
the `Consumption Record`. The index should be a positive integer: 1, 2, 3, ...
* Date follows yyyy-mm-dd format.
* The `vomit` command has some default behavior when you choose to not provide values for certain `Prefixes`. Do note that
this is not the same as excluding optional parameters.
- If you do not provide the date, or if its `Prefix` does not have a value,
Calgo will by default take it that you `vomit` today.
- If you do not provide the portion, or if its `Prefix` does not have a value,
Calgo will by default take it that you wish to `vomit` the whole portion `Food`, resulting in the deletion of that entire entry.
- If you specified a portion greater than what you have consumed, the entire entry will be deleted as well.
* Using `vomit` on a portion of food will not affect its ratings.
If you gave a rating by mistake, you can use the `undo` command,
which will be available from version 2.0 onwards.
****

Format: `vomit num/INDEX [d/DATE] [portion/PORTION]`

<<<

Example: Let's say you ordered a glass of Bandung and previously used `nom` with `PORTION` set to 1.
However, because the drink was too sweet, you only finished half a glass, you can use `vomit` to adjust your
`Consumption Record`. Here's how you can do this:

image::VomitCommandBefore.png[]

You should enter `vomit num/1 portion/0.5`, then press kbd:[enter].

image::VomitCommandAfter.png[]

As you can see from the `Consumption Record` panel, the portion has been reduced to 0.5.
The `Graph Display` also reflects a drop in calories.
