[[Terminology]]
== Terminology (Branson)
_This section provides a quick description for the common terminologies used in this user guide._

*Task*: A task is something that you need to complete. It is represented as a card on the right side of the window. Set reminders, add tags and more to better manage your tasks!

*Pomodoro*: A productivity technique that consists of doing focused work for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break. This technique prevents you from tiring out while doing work.

*Pet*: The pet you will interact with to manage your tasks and Pomodoros. You can also level up the pet by completing more tasks/Pomodoros.

=== Pet (Fyonn)
anchor:pet[]
_This section provides information about the virtual pet_

==== What's Pet?
BB productive provides you with a virtual pet to act as your companion to motivate you to do work. It is also a visual embodiment of your productivity so as to remind you of your productivity progress. The pet achieves these functions through three components: Experience points, Evolution and Pet's Mood.

==== Experience (XP) Points
Just like in a game, the pet has experience (XP) points that are used to level up. Notice whenever a task is done, the XP increases by 5 points? You can also increase the XP by 25 points when you finish a Pomodoro cycle. When the XP points accumulates to a total of 100, the pet levels up! Through this reward system, you will be motivated to start doing your work and completing them! Proceed to the next section for information about the evolution of the pet.

.Done Before
image::UG_Done_before.png[width=790]

.Done After
image::UG_Done_Finish.png[width=790]

==== Evolution

The pet has three stages in its evolution: the baby, the teenager and the dad. Each level can be achieved after every successive accumulation of 100 XP points. Can't wait to see your pet grow? Start doing work to gain more XP!

.Evolution of Pet
image::BBProductiveGrowing.png[width=790]

==== Pet's Mode
Oh no! Is your pet looking like it is angry? You might be wondering why. That is because the pet has two moods: *Happy* and *Hangry*. When the pet is happy, that means you have been consistent in your work. Good Job! However, when the pet is hangry, that indicates that you have not been doing work for awhile. The pet acts as a visual cue to remind you when you have not been productive in awhile. Want to make your pet happy again? Start doing work now!

.Example of different hangry modes

//tag::pomodoro[]
[[Pomodoro]]
=== Pomodoro (Hardy)
anchor:pomodoro[]
_In this section, let's learn how you can take advantage of the Pomodoro feature to boost your productivity! Learn all the commands you can use for Pomodoro._

==== What's Pomodoro?
In the late 1980s, a gentleman named Francesco Cirillo devised a time management method called the Pomodoro Technique. Essentially, a single cycle consists of two parts, 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5 minutes break. This cycle repeats for as long as you want to get work done.

==== Let's get started!
BBProductive's Pomodoro feature is very easy to use. Let's take a look at the following steps!

===== Step 1: `pom` a task to get started!

You can activate the Pomodoro timer and set a task you want to focus on. The default timer for a work cycle is 25 minutes. However, you can add an optional timer amount field for a particular cycle.

Format: `pom <index> [tm/<amount in minutes>]`

[IMPORTANT]
====
Indexes refer to the current tasklist on display, it does not refer to the indices of the entire task list. Note that indexes start from 1 and not 0.

You can input a value  (decimals allowed) following the prefix `tm/` to represent your desired amount of time in *minutes* for a particular Pomodoro cycle.
====

After you've successfully _pommed_ a task, you can see the task's name in the bar at the top of the task list. The timer there will start counting down as well.

.Example screen when pom is successfully executed
image::pom_success.png[width=790]

===== Step 2: `pom pause` if you need to take a quick break.

Not exactly a break. But let's say you need to leave your desk real quick. You can pause a running Pomodoro timer by simply calling `pom pause`.

Once you've paused Pomodoro, the timer will freeze and remain so until you resume in the next step.

.Example screen when pom is successfully paused
image::pom_pause.png[width=790]

===== Step 3: `pom continue` to get back to work.

Now that you're back and ready to get back to work, simply use `pom continue` to resume for where you left off.

.Example screen when pom is successfully resumed
image::pom_continuing.png[width=790]

===== Step 4: Time's up!

Once the timer expires, the app will prompt you if you have finished the task. You need only respond with Yes (Y) or No (N) in order to proceed.

.Prompt when the Pomodoro timer expires
image::pom_time_expire.png[width=790]

===== Step 5: Break-time!
Afterwards, the app will prompt you if you would like to begin a 5-minute break (as per the Pomodoro technique). Similarly, you need to respond with Yes (Y) or No (N). Responding with No(N) will set the app to its neutral state. Responding with a Yes(Y) will start the break timer.

.Prompt checking if you'd like to take a break
image::pom_prompt_break.png[width=790]

[IMPORTANT]
=====
You will not be able to execute other commands during these prompts. Please respond to the prompts to proceed.
=====
===== Back to Step 1
At the end of the break, the app will return to its "neutral" state. Wish to start on another Pomodoro cycle? Head back to step 1 for another journey of productivity.

.End of Pomodoro cycle screen
image::pom_break_end.png[width=790]

//end::pomodoro[]
//tag::statisticsug[]

=== Statistics (Permas)
anchor:statistics[]
As you continue to use BB Productive, you may start to wonder how productive you have been over time. This is where our Statistics feature comes in! Simply type in the command `stats` to access the Statistics Tab and track your productivity. Look out for the background color of the "Statistics" Tab. If it turns orange after you run the command, you are on the correct tab.



.Statistics Tab
image::stats_tab.png[width=400]

The Statistics Tab consists of two features to help you keep track of your productivity : the Daily Challenge and the productivity charts.

==== Daily Challenge
The Daily Challenge tracks the total duration you have completed with the Pomodoro running on the current day. The more you run the Pomodoro, the more the progress bar fills, and the closer you are to clearing the challenge! Try to clear the Daily Challenge every day to hit your productivity goals!

[TIP]
====
You can customize the duration you aim to achieve on a daily basis by using the Set Command as described in <<settings, Section 6.11 Set Commands>>.
====

==== Productivity Charts
The Productivity Charts tracks two main data points daily. Firstly, it tracks the number of tasks you have completed. Secondly, it tracks the total duration you ran the Pomodoro. With this information, you can gauge your productivity over time and make proper adjustments to your schedule to improve your productivity. If you start noticing the orange bars getting shorter, realize that it is time to buckle up and work harder, or else you may lose your productivity momentum!
//end::statisticsug[]

//tag::AutoComplete[]
=== AutoComplete (Branson)
As much as you enjoy typing, we've added some extra grease to help you type even faster. You can trigger our intelligent autocomplete function by pressing `tab` on the keyboard.

You can expect: +

* Auto completion of command words: `del -> delete`

.Command word auto complete
image::AC_command.png[]
* Addition of prefixes for common values: `20/10/20@10:30 -> r/20/10/20@10:30`

.Prefix auto complete
image::prefix_complete.png[]
* Auto completion of sort fields `sort pri` -> `sort priority`

.Sort auto complete
image::sort_complete.png[]
* Removal of indexes that are invalid [not a positive integer or out of the tasklist's size]

.Done index removal
image::AC_removal_success.png[]
* If we can't find a valid command, you will observe feedback like below:

.Auto complete not found
image::complete_fail.png[]

//end::AutoComplete[]

//tag::reminder[]

=== Reminders (Arthur)

==== What's a reminder?
BBProductive provides you with the option to remind you during those forgetful times. BBProductive can help to remind you to do time-sensitive tasks such as taking temperature in the afternoon. When the time for the reminder has arrived, BBProductive alerts you to do the task! Never forget to buy milk or any other time-sensitive task ever again!

==== How do you use it?
You can add a reminder to your task by adding `r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` when editing or adding a task. A pop up containing the task name and description will then appear reminding you to complete the task at the specified date and time.

==== Command `r/DD/MM/YY@HH:MM`
===== Add Task with reminder
Add a task with a reminder using the following command `add n/<name> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more.

For example: `add n/Buy Milk r/11/11/20@23:59`.

After you have successfully added the task, you will see the following success message in the dialogue box!

.Success for adding a task with reminder on result display(top).
image::AddTaskReminderUp.png[width=395]

.Success for adding a task with reminder on result display(scroll to bottom).
image::AddTaskReminderDown.png[width=395]

.Success for adding a task with reminder(top).
image::reminder_add_success.png[width=790]

[IMPORTANT]
====
- Firstly, the format for the date must adhere strictly to the `r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` format or else it will not be recognized.
- Secondly, the date can only be set in the future and not the past. +
An error message will be shown on the result display if either of the 2 aforementioned issues is breached. This applies when editing a task to have a reminder as well.
====

===== Edit Task with reminder
Edit a task to include a reminder with the following command `edit <index> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:MM`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more.

For example: `edit 1 r/01/11/20@11:59`.

This results in a task with the reminder's date in the task card as well as result display giving feedback.

.Success for editing task's reminder, reminder date appears on task card.
image::reminder_edit_success.png[width=790]

//end::reminder[]

//tag::recurring[]
=== Recurring (Arthur)

==== What's Recurring?
Have a task you need to complete every day or every week? BBProductive has you covered with recurring tasks! Add a recurring task and the task will be marked as unfinished every day or every week? This means not having to add the same task over and over again! Furthermore, you can accompany these recurring tasks with reminders. Now you don't have to worry about forgetting to do your daily or weekly tasks!

==== How do you use it?
Add a recurring attribute to your task by adding `rec/d` for daily recurring tasks or `rec/w` for weekly. This will trigger the recurring behaviour for the task, meaning tasks will be reset according to the delay you set! This means after marking a task as done, the next day (or week) it will be marked as unfinished. For reminders, BBProductive will also add a day(or week) to the reminder date! This ensures you are reminded on a recurring basis!

===== Command `rec/d` or `rec/w`
===== Add Task with recurring
Add a task with a recurring attribute using the following command `add n/<name> rec/d` or `add n/<name> rec/w`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more.

For example: `add n/Buy Milk rec/d`

After you have successfully added the task, you will see the following success message in the dialogue box!

.Success for adding a task with recurring attribute on result display(top).
image::AddTaskRecurringUp.png[width=395]

.Success for adding a task with recurring attribute on result display(scroll to bottom).
image::AddTaskRecurringDown.png[width=395]

You will see the task appear in the tasklist with a recurring attribute at the side!

.Success for adding recurring attribute to task card.
image::recurring_add_success.png[width=790]

[IMPORTANT]
====
The format for recurring is strictly `rec/d` or `rec/w` as there are only daily and weekly recurring tasks. Any other input will be recognized as invalid and an error message will be shown on the result display.
====

===== Edit Task with recurring
Want to make an existing task recurring? You can edit a task to include a recurring with the following command `edit <index> rec/d` or `edit <index> rec/w`. You can also include the other flags such as `t/`, `des/` and more.

For example: `edit 1 rec/w`.

Once completed, you will see that the task details will be updated with a recurring attribute.

.Task card now has a weekly recurring attribute
image::EditRecurringTaskWeekly.png[width=790]

=== Recurring behaviour when a task is marked as done (Arthur)
Mark a task as done as you would normally using the command `done <index>`. For a recurring task, after the stipulated amount of time(either daily or weekly), the task will be reset as unfinished.

For example: `done 1` on a daily recurring task.

.Task initially marked as done on a task card.
image::recurring_behaviour_done.png[width=790]

After one day, the task will be set from done to unfinished, meaning the tick in the checkbox will disappear.

.Task has been reset shown on result display.
image::recurring_behaviour_undone_resultDisplay.png[width=395]

.Task has been reset as shown on the task card.
image::recurring_behaviour_undone.png[width=790]

=== Recurring behaviour when the task has a reminder (Arthur)
Add a reminder as you would normally using the command `edit <index> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm` or `add n/<name> r/DD/MM/YY@HH:mm rec/<type>` if you are adding the task. For a recurring task, after the stipulated amount of time(either daily or weekly), the reminder will be incremented by the time interval if it has been triggered. This means that the reminder will be incremented by 1 day if the time interval is daily, and 7 days if the time interval is weekly.

.Task initially has a reminder for 13th April 2020 at 9:32 PM.
image::recurring_behaviour_reminder.png[width=790]

After one day, you will see that the reminder time is updated!

.Task has been reset shown on task card with an updated reminder time of 14th April 2020 at 9:32 PM.

=== Set Commands (Fyonn)
anchor:settings[]
_This section explains how to use the set commands_

Tired of the name "BB"? Is 25 minutes of Pomodoro time too short for you? Want to achieve more with the daily challenge? BB productive provides you with the option to customize the various features! Simply use the set commands to customize it the way you want.

command: `set [pet/PETNAME] [pom/POMDURATION] [daily/DAILYTARGET]`

[TIP]
Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `pet/PETNAME pom/POMDURATION`, `pom/POMDURATION pet/PETNAME` is also acceptable.

For example, you might like the name to be "Momu", the Pomodoro duration to be 30 mins and the daily challenge target to be 150 minutes. To do so, run this command:

eg. Command `set pet/Momu pom/30 daily/150`

.Set before
image::UG_Set_Before.png[width="790"]

Once the set is successful, you will see this success message being displayed.

.set success message
