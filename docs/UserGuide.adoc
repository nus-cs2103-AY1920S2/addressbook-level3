== Introduction

FitHelper (FH) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing daily diet and exercises*. More importantly, FH is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FH can get your weight management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

FitHelper mainly serves as a fitness log book where users can *mark down their diet and exercises entries* and *be reminded about their plans*. They can also *visualize their performance* to be encouraged.


== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `FitHelper.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Helper.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

// tag::command_format[]
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/running`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/swimming r/energy consuming but fun` or as `n/running`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[r/remark]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `r/really fun`, `r/really fun r/helps me lose weight` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME t/2020-04-10-08:00`, `t/2020-04-10-18:00 n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* The field `TYPE` or `x/` in this document refers to type of entries: food/sport, it can also be write in short form: f/s.

Edits the name of the 2nd entry from food entry list to be `Fries` and clears all existing remarks.

==== Mark an entry as done

Users can mark an entry as done, either a meal or sports, where the calories intake and consumption will be taken in to consideration.
Format: `edit x/TYPE i/INDEX s/Done`

==== Mark an entry as undone

Similar to the previous command, marking an entry as undone edits the `s/` field and modify it as `Undone`.
Format: `edit x/TYPE i/INDEX s/Undone`
//end::edit[]

// tag::find[]
=== Locating entries by name: `find`

Finds entries whose names contain any of the given keywords. +

If the `TYPE` field is empty, FitHelper will search from the whole list.

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `apples` will match `Apples`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Apple Pie` will match `Pie Apple`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Straw` will not match `Strawberries`
* Entries matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Apple Banana` will return `Apple Pie`, `Banana Milkshake`
****

Examples:

* `find x/s k/running` +

* `find x/food k/Juice Apple` +
Returns any entry having names `Juice`,  or `Apple`
//end::find[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Deleting an entry : `delete`

Deletes the specified entry from the fitness log book. +
Format: `delete x/TYPE i/INDEX`

[WARNING]
If `delete` is called right after a `find` command (when a shortened list is displayed), the index follows the current list view
after executing `find` command. i.e. If entry X originally has an index 3 and currently has an index 1 after the `find` command,
calling `delete ... i/1` will successfully delete entry X.
****
* Deletes the entry at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed entry list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `delete x/sports index/2`
Deletes the 2nd sports entry in the sports list from dashboard.
//end::delete[]

=== Keep a diary

The user can keep a diary in FitHelper, and command for adding/editing/deleting/searching/clearing diary logs.

* `diary` switches to the `Diary Page` where all diary logs are displayed in chronological order

==== Add a new diary

* `addDiary d/DATE dc/DIARYCONTENT` +
adds a new diary on the specified `DATE` with the specified `CONTENT` +

If there is previously added diary on the specified `DATE`, calling `addDiary` will rewrite the content.

Examples:

* `addDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/Happy birthday Alice!`
Adds a diary log on the date `2020-03-31` with the content `Happy birthday Alice!`.

==== Append new content to an existing diary
* `appendDiary d/DATE dc/APPENDED CONTENT` +

This command appends the new diary content to the existing the diary log on the date `2020-03-31`.
The new diary content after this command will be "Happy birthday Alice! You are one year older now:)".

==== Edit a diary
* `editDiary d/DATE dc/NEW DIARYCONTENT` +
edits the diary on the specified `DATE` with the new `DIARYCONTENT`. +

If the specified `DATE` does not have previously added diary log, this command will be discarded with a `DIARY_NOT_FOUND`
reminder.
If the existing diary with the specified `DATE` has the same content as the specified content, this command will be discarded with a `DUPLICATE_DIARY`
reminder.

Examples:

* `editDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/Happy birthday Alice!` +
This command edits the content of the diary log on the date `2020-03-31` with the content `Happy birthday Alice!`.

==== Delete a diary

This command deletes the diary log on the date `2020-03-3`, if the diary on this date exists, and discards the command
if no diary was added previously on this date.

==== Find a diary
* `findDiary [d/DATE] [k/ONE OR MORE KEYWORDS]` +
finds diaries either on the specified `DATE` or contains the specified `KEYWORDS`. +

If there is no diary under the specified `DATE`, this command will be discarded with the reminder of
`DIARY_NOT_FOUND`.

****
* The field `DATE` has higher priority than `KEYWORDS` in the search.
i.e. If the `DATE` field is non-empty, regardless of the presence and the content of the `KEYWORDS` field,
the diary under that date will be displayed. If the specified `DATE` contains no previous diary logs,
no diary will be listed.
* If the field `DATE` is left empty, only the `KEYWORDS` field is considered in the search,
similar to the case of `find` command for food/sport entries.
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `apples` will match `Apples`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Apple Pie` will match `Pie Apple`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Straw` will not match `Strawberries`
* Entries matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Apple Banana` will return `Apple Pie`, `Banana Milkshake`
****

Examples:

* `findDiary k/running` +
Displays diaries with their content containing the keyword `running`, ignoring the letter capitalization.
* `find d/2020-03-31 k/cake` +

This command back-roll FitHelper to the previous status before the last undoable command was executed.
[NOTE]
Undoable commands include: `add`, `edit`, `delete`, `clear`, `addDiary`, `appendDiary`, `editDiary`, `deleteDiary`, `clearDiary`.
Other commands are not affected by `undo` command. The same applies for `redo`.
[NOTE]
After executing `undo` or `redo`, FitHelper switches to `Home Page` (`DashBoard`).

Examples:

* `undo` (after `addDiary d/2020-03-31 dc/I am happy.`) +
This `undo` commands remove the added diary log from FitHelper.
//end::undo

//tag::redo
=== Redo : `redo`

`redo` is the reverse of `undo`. +
This command re-execute the last undoable command that has been undone.
[WARNING]

Format: `profile`

=== Update Profile Data : `update`

Update user data in the profile by attributes. Profile attributes include: Name, Age, Address, Gender, Height and Target Weight. +
Every `update` command will lead to the profile page. +

Format: `update [-f] attr/ATTRIBUTE v/VALUE`

****
* If no user profile data is provided by the user, FitHelper will initialize with the sample profile data.
* The updated attribute name is *not* case-sensitive and can include spaces, but the name must match some fields in user profile.
* e.g. Both `attr/target weight` and `attr/TARGETWEIGHT` are acceptable.
* Any updated value should follow its original data type.
* If the chosen updated attribute has already had original value, *flag `-f`* need to be used to enable *force overwrite*.

****

Examples:

* `update attr/height v/160`
* `update -f attr/name v/Alice Wang`

=== Weight Page: `weight`

Weight page serves to be a summary for user's weight and BMI changes according to time. +
It shows user data in graph for easy understanding. By default, it will generate graph from all history data chronologically.

* *Gap notification* +
The top notification shows the comparison between user current weight and target weight. +
- If current weight is *larger* than target, the gap between the two will be highlighted.
- If current weight is *the same or less* than the target, a succeed notification will be generated.

* *Trend Graph - Weight* +
Display a trend graph of user's weight according to time.

* *Trend Graph - BMI* +
Display a trend graph of user's BMI according to time. The BMI value is calculated by weight and height value at that date.

Format: `weight`

=== Add Weight Records : `addWeight`

Add a new weight record into the weight records database. A weight record is related to date and weight value, and a auto-computed BMI value will be stored as well. +
Every `addWeight` command will lead to the weight page. If the new weight record is added successfully, explicit changes of new points in the two trend graph can be found. +

Format: `addWeight v/WEIGHT_VALUE [d/DATE]`

****
* If no weight record exists in the database, "Not Available Now" will be shown in profile page's Current Weight and Current BMI fields.
* The date of the new weighe record can be *omitted*. By default, it will refer to the date of today.
* The date should be in format of `yyyy-MM-dd`.
* *No two weight records should have the same date.* If adding a weight record with the same date as an existing weight, a warning will be generated, and thus fail to add.
****

Examples:

* `addWeight v/50.0 d/2020-02-01`
* `addWeight v/52.30`

=== Calendar View: `calendar`
Calendar view will display all the food and sports entries for each day of the referenced week/month. The referenced date is default set to be the current date, but can be changed to a user given date. Calendar can be switched between two modes, list mode or timetable mode, with default set to be in timetable mode. +

*For list mode*:

* *Monthly View* +
The lists of entries for food and sports are display by their given dates in the referenced month. Completed entries will be strikethrough. Calorie value is also shown for each date.

* *Calendar of the month* +
On the top right corner, the dates of the referenced month displayed, with red-colored date if the given date has more calorie intake than calorie burnt (considering the entries with status done of that particular date), else if calorie burnt is greater than calorie intake, the font color is green. Default color is blue. For each date, upon clicking, a popup window will show all entries of the date. The ones with strikethrough in text means the status of the entry is done. For this functionality, the corresponding command is `calendar sh/DATE`.

* *Daily tasks completion status* +
On the bottom right corner, completion status for existing entries will be displayed by their dates, showing the calorie intake from food, calorie burnt from sports as well as total calorie. The calculation only considers entries which are completed.


*For timetable mode:* +


* *Weekly View* +
The entries of food and sports of the given time period are displayed. Food entries will be in pink, sports entries will be in blue, and entries completed will be in grey regardless of their type. No entries can have time clashes. Entries with long names or locations will not be displayed fully. Only when mouse is over the entry, the details will be shown. Entries upon clicking will have console errors, caused by disabling certain functionality from third party libraries.

* *Calendar of the month* +
Same as above.

* *Upcoming list* +
It displays all entries after the current date and time and within the referenced month. Only entries with status "undone" will be shown. So if the referenced month is in the past, no entries will be shown. +

Format for entering calendar view: `calendar` +
Format for switching to timetable mode: `calendar m/tb` +
Format for switching to list mode: `calendar m/ls` +
Format for changing the referenced date: `calendar d/DATE` +
Format for showing entries of a particular date: `calendar sh/DATE`

Examples:

* `calendar m/ls d/2020-04-20`
* `calendar sh/2020-05-01`

//tag::today[]
=== Today Page

Today page serves to be a summary for the daily arrangements. +
It shows the daily schedule for the user. Users can see the entries for the day, a recommended lunch place, and their performances. They can also see their diary for the day as well as the rewarding point. +
Format: `today`

* *Daily Food/Sports Entries* +
The lists of food and sports entries on "today" are displayed in two list view, with indices in chronological order specific for today.

* *Plan Counter* +
The 4 counters keep track of the number of done/undone food/sports plans on today.

* *Calorie Report* +
Calorie report contains the data of daily calorie intake/consumption from done food/sports entries correspondingly.
The food calorie pie chart consists of all food entries on today, regardless of the status. The labels are the corresponding indices
of the food entries in `Today's Food` list.
From the pie chart, the user can view the component of calorie intake of each food entry, so he/she can adjust the diet plan.
[WARNING]
In cases where some food entries contribute to the great majority of the total food intake, the pie chart only displays labels for
food entries that contain relatively high calorie values.

* *Task Completion* +
The user's daily task completion is shown in percentage (round to integer).

* *FitHelper Feedback* +
Based on the user's intake food calorie and sport task completion, FitHelper provides suggestions and reminders
in the `FitHelper Feedback` area.

==== [proposed][comes in v1.4] Some Day Page

The `Today Page` for some day in the history can be displayed.
Format: `today DATE`

[TIP]
The `DATE` should be equal or prior to `today`. Requiring a `Today Page` for a future #date# will generate a blank page if that particular day does not have any entries.

Examples:

* `today`
* `today 2020-02-14`

=== [proposed][comes in v1.4] Weekly Report

A weekly report serves as a summary for the past week. The user can see his performance in the past week. The weekly report also contains his rewarding points, diary logs, and preferred sports and food from the previous week. +
Format: `weekreport`

* *Weekly Performance* +
The weekly performance is generated based on the ratio of done and undone tasks and the calorie consumption, together with the system feedbacks.

* *Rewarding Points* +
Rewarding points gained from the past week and current "fit level" is also shown. The weekly increment of rewarding points from past several weeks can be visualized.

* *Trendy Food and Sports* +
Users can see his preferred food and sports, based on his entries for the past week.

==== Some Week Report

The `Week Report` for some week in the history can be displayed. +
Format: `weekreport DATE` where `DATE` specifies the week it is in

[TIP]
The `DATE` should be equal or prior to days in the current week. Requiring a `Week Report` for a future week will generate a blank page if that particular day does not have any entries.

Examples:

* `weekreport`
* `weekreport 2020-02-14`
//end::today[]

=== Sort food/sports entry list: `sort`

Sorts food or sports entry list, or both of them, based on starting time or
calorie value or name of the entry (case insensitive), in either ascending or descending order.
In addition, the reminders entry list will also be sorted in the same manner specified by the user.
The user must specify the sorting criterion `cal/c OR time/t OR name/n`.
If the user does not specify the type of entry list, both lists will be sorted.
And if the user does not specify the sorting order `a OR d`,
the default order is descending (i.e. entry that starts later
or entry with higher calorie value or entry whose name starts with
later alphabet comes first).

format: `sort [x/TYPE] by/SORT_BY [o/ORDER]`

Examples:

* `sort x/f by/time o/a` (sort food entry list and reminders list in ascending order of recording time,
i.e. the older entry comes first)
* `sort by/c` (sort both food and sports entry list, as well as reminders list,
in descending order of calorie value, i.e. entry with higher calorie intake/consumption comes first)

=== Check calorie intake/consumption of common food/sports: `check`

Searches through the pre-set database for calorie intake/consumption information
about common food/sports (i.e. a datum) whose name matches/contains keywords specified by the user.
Note that due to space constraint, at most 3 matching data will be shown
at the left-bottom corner of the application. Each datum shows the name of
the food/sports and its calorie intake/consumption information: for food, it will be
in cal per serving (weight per serving in gram will also be shown); for sports, it will
be in cal per hour. The searching works as follows:

* Retrieves food/sports data based on check type specified by the user.
* Checks and adds food/sports datum whose name **equals one of the keywords**.
* If fewer than 3 food/sports data are added so far, checks and adds food/sports datum
whose name **contains the keywords as a whole**.
* If still fewer than 3 food/sports data are added so far, checks and adds food/sports datum
whose name **contains one of the keywords**.
* If no datum is added after all the steps, replies user that search failed.
Otherwise, shows user the data.

format: `check x/TYPE k/ONE_OR_MORE_KEYWORDS`

Examples:

* `check x/food k/apple` (searches for calorie intake of food
whose name match/contain keyword "apple")
