=== Definition of Common Words Used

Context::
There are some commands that are only permissible at certain states of the application.
For instance, the `review` and `rate` commands are only allowed after navigating to the transactions screen.
We refer to this state as a *context*. Commands which specify a context which they are used in generally cannot work outside of that context.
However, some commands are less particular about the context which they run in
such as in the case of the `enter` command which can run in both the Main, Canteen and Stall contexts.

GUI::
Graphic User Interface is a type of visual interface that allows users to interact with.

Index::
It is a number that is linked to the item of the list
An index is limited to the maximum number of items shown in the list, the item does not exist if an invalid index is specified in commands that use an index.

[[Features]]
== Features

====
[red]*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `budget set w/ AMOUNT`, `AMOUNT` is a parameter which can be used as `budget set w/ 9.50`
* Items in square brackets are optional entries e.g `report [w/DATE]` can be entered as `report [w/ 12-02-2020]` or as `report`.
* _Canteen names_, _stall names_ and _commands_ are *case sensitive*.
====

=== Back Command: `*back*`  <Done By: Ignatius>

If you want to return to your previous screen, just key in `*back*` and it'll bring you back
(at least if a previous screen exists).

Format: `back`

=== List all Canteens: `*list*`  <Done By: Leslie>

Curious to discover the range of dining options on campus? Simply enter `*list*` into the command box
and FoodieBot will show you all the fabulous canteens on campus for you to browse at your leisure.

Format: `list`

Parameters:

*  `[f/BLOCK_NAME]` - If you want to view the canteens by their distance from the place specified by
`BLOCK_NAME`, this is the tag for you. This will list the canteens in order of increasing distance from
`BLOCK_NAME`.

TIP: You can also type `list` into the command box to return to the main page. This is a handy shortcut if
you ever forget which *Context* you're in.

=== Go to a Canteen: `*goto*`  <Done By: Leslie>

If you're ever lost in NUS, worry no more! The `goto` function can conveniently tell you the directions to the canteen you wish to
go to from your current location which you have indicated. It even includes a map image to aid you with understanding
the directions even easier.

NOTE: This function will only work on the main page.

Format: `goto CANTEEN_NAME f/ CURRENT_LOCATION`

Parameters:

* `CANTEEN_NAME`: The canteen name
* `CURRENT_LOCATION`: The nearest block from your current location

These `CURRENT LOCATION`(s) are available for directions:

* com1

These `CURRENT LOCATION`(s) will be added in future releases
(but are recognised as valid locations):

* pgpr
* uhc
* utown

NOTE: `CANTEEN_NAME` and `CURRENT_LOCATION` field has to be one of the suggestions. Otherwise an error message will be displayed telling the user to provide a valid `CANTEEN_NAME` and `CURRENT_LOCATION`.

====
Example:: Let say you wish to go to The Deck from your current location at com1.
====
. Enter the canteen which you want to go to and your current location in this format on the main page `goto The Deck f/ com1`.
+
image::wireframe/gotoStep1.PNG[width="700", align="left"]

.  Then press kbd:[Enter]. This will give you a clear image and instruction on how to get to canteen from the nearest bus stop.

image::wireframe/gotoStep2.PNG[width="700", align="left"]


=== View Stalls or Menu: `*enter*`  <Done By: Ignatius>

Curious about the details of a particular canteen or stall? The `enter` command allows you to find out
all the information you want about the canteen or stall you are interested in.

Format: `enter STALL_NAME/ CANTEEN_NAME/ INDEX`

Parameters:

* `INDEX`: An index that corresponds to a particular canteen. This index is located beside the canteen name.
* `CANTEEN_NAME`: The canteen name has to be from one of the canteens displayed. Partial names are not allowed.
* `STALL_NAME`:  The stall name has to be from one of the stalls displayed. Partial names are not allowed.

NOTE: Information about the types of food sold at the stall, the rating of the stall and various other things will be implemented in v2.0. +
The stall's rating is determined from the user's past experiences of the food items which were selected (find out
more in Section 4.13: Rate Food Items).

====
Example:: You wish to see the stalls available in Nus Flavors.
====
. On the main screen, type `enter Nus Flavors` or `enter 1` into the command box.
+
image::wireframe/enterStep1.PNG[width="700", align="left"]

. This will display the list of stalls that Nus Flavors has.
At the bottom of the screen, there will be a display box which displays the current canteen which you
have entered.
+
image::wireframe/enterStep2.PNG[width="700", align="left"]

* If you wish to view stalls in another canteen you can enter `back` into the command box. This will bring you back to the main page.

. If you wish to see the menu of a stall, you can key in `enter` again.
Let us see what the Western stall has on their menu. You can key in `enter Western` or `enter 9`.
Don't forget to hit the kbd:[enter] after you are done typing.

. This will show you the menu of the Western stall.
For each food item, the name, the cost and the description of the food item will be given.
At the bottom of the screen, there will also be a display box showing the current stall which you have entered.
+
image::wireframe/enterStall.PNG[width="700", align="left"]

* Similarly, you can also enter `back` to return to the Nus Flavor canteen screen or enter `list` if you wish to return to the main screen.


=== Select the Food : `*select*`  <Done By: Shaun>

Finally decided on a food item after browsing the countless food options at NUS, ordered it and want to record
down your dining experience? The `*select*` function is here allowing you to save your selected food
into your past transactions to help you track your history of food consumption.

Format: `select`

Parameters:

* `INDEX`: Select the food with the given index from the list displayed on the GUI
* `FOOD_NAME`: Select the food with the given name from the list displayed on the GUI

NOTE: If a budget has been set up, the price of the selected food will be automatically deducted from your
budget. This helps you keep track of how much money you have spent and how much more you can spend. Nifty, isn't it?

Example:: You have decided what you want to eat and you want to save that item to update your transaction history.

. Ensure that you are on the menu screen of the stall. If you do not know how to get to the menu you can refer to the section above or <<View Stalls or Menu, here>>.

. Continuing on from the example from the `*enter*` command above, we are currently in the Western stall.
+
image::wireframe/enterStall.PNG[width="700", align="left"]

. Enter `select Combo Set` or `select 1` into the command box.

. This will display the cost of the item, the remaining amount that you have and the amount you are left with to spend for the day.

image::wireframe/select.png[width="700", align="left"]


=== Randomize Food Selection : `*randomize*`  <Done By: Samantha>

Bamboozled by the countless dining options at NUS or simply bored of going to the same boring old canteens to
eat everyday? `randomize` is here to help you to generate a random option when you cannot decide on what to eat or
if you just want to spice up your culinary experience in NUS.

Format: `randomize`

Parameters:

* `[c/ CANTEEN_NAME]` - Produce a randomized list of foods from foods available at the particular canteen .
* `[t/ TAG]` - Randomize based on foods which are tagged with the tag provided.

====
Example:: On a day where you cannot decide on what to eat but you don't mind travelling anywhere on campus, you suddenly
remember that FoodieBot has a convenient `randomize` function.
====
. Just enter `randomize` into the command box on the main screen.
+
image::wireframe/randomizeStep1.PNG[width="700", align="left"]

. This will generate 1 option for you with the details of the _canteen name_ that this stall belongs to, the _stall name_, the _stall number_,
the _price rating_ and the tag if there are any.
+
image::wireframe/randomize.png[width="700", align="left"]

* If you like the option that you see, you can key in `enter Japanese` or `enter 1` to be redirected to the stall to see the menu.

* If you do not like the option, you can enter `randomize` again to be given another option.

====
Example:: What if you want to get a random option only from a particular canteen (eg. The Deck) that you are at or an option based on what you crave (eg. spicy food)?
====

* If you want to get a random option based on the canteen (eg. The Deck), you can enter `randomize c/ The Deck` on the main screen.
This will display an option that is based on the canteen you want (in this case The Deck).
* If you want to get a random option based on your craving (eg. spicy), you can enter `randomize t/ spicy` on the main screen.
This will display a food which has the spicy tag.

* OR similarly, you can also enter the canteen first before getting a random option.
. In the command box key in `enter The deck` or `enter 2` to get the list of stalls available in The Deck.
+
image::wireframe/enterDeck.PNG[width="700", align="left"]
. After that enter `randomize` or `randomize t/ TAG` to get an option. +
Let's try getting a food option that has rice from The deck
+
image::wireframe/randomizeTag.PNG[width="700", align="left"]

. This will display an option if there is a stall option that has that tag. Otherwise it will display a message in the feedback box.
+

=== Set a Budget : `*budget set*`  <Done By: Xavier>

Have problems keeping track of your spending? The `budget set` command allows you to set up
a daily, weekly or monthly budget to help you track how much money you have left to spend. This budget
can be changed anytime you want but please note the consequences in the box below!

NOTE: Changing the budget will reset the budget overview for the current budget cycle. +
For example, if you have $5 remaining from a weekly budget of $20, setting a new monthly budget of $150
will update your current budget settings to the new one, but at the same time resets the start date
of the cycle, your remaining budget, as well as an overview of your spendings in your budget. +
(But not to worry, all of your transactions are still saved!)

NOTE: When you set a weekly or monthly budget, you get to see an average daily budget available to
spend over 5 days (if weekly) or 20 days (if monthly). Sometimes you may want to comfort yourself,
so it’s still okay to spend more than the daily average budget, as long as your remaining budget
doesn’t reach $0 before the end of the week/month!

Format: `budget set PERIOD AMOUNT`

Parameters:

* `AMOUNT`: The maximum amount available to spend for the given time period.
* `PERIOD`: The length of the cycle that a budget is effective for and when it will refresh.
+
List of values for `PERIOD` are:
+
** `d/` - Daily
** `w/` - Weekly
** `m/` - Monthly

NOTE: `PERIOD` field has to be one of the above suggestions. +
`AMOUNT` field has to be numeric (with or without decimal places). +
Otherwise an error message will be displayed requesting a correct type to be provided.

****
Examples:

`*budget set d/ 10*`::
** Set daily budget to $10.
`*budget set w/ 30.50*`::
** Set weekly budget to $30.50.
`*budget set m/ 100*`::
Set monthly budget to $100.
