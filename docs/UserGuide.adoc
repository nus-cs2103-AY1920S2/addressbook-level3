== Introduction



=== An Introduction to NUSProductivity User guide

- NUSProductivity is an application designed for all NUS students to better manage their school work. The app is set out to enhance your productivity in school through 5 main features, module planning, CAP (cumulative average point) tracking, note taking, deadline and task listing, and finally, diary logging. This app is designed only for NUS students for now with the possibility to customise it for students from other universities in the future. More importantly, NUSProductivity is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Read on to get you started on using the application!

- The purpose of this document is for you to familiarise yourself with the functions and capabilities of what NUSProductivity can do.

- The image below shows the different parts of the user interface of NUSProductivity

// tag::Calendar[]

=== Calendar

The calendar feature in the app that allows you to schedule and set deadline for important tasks such as project or assignment deadlines.

The application allows you to add 2 type of tasks, `deadline` and `moduleTask`.

`moduleTask` allows you to tag a module, that you have already inputted in your Profile tab, to the task itself. It allows you to set the priority level of the task.

`deadline` allows you to input a deadline event into the calendar without any specified modules attached to it.

==== Priority Levels

We give you the flexibility to choose and indicate what priority each `moduleTask` should have. This priority is represented from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest priority and 5 being the highest.

.NUSProductivity calendar priority levels

.Adding Deadlines
image::deadlineAdd.png[width="790"]

After invoking the command, the deadline will be added to the calendar as shown in figure 5. The task will be tagged as light grey to signify it is uncompleted yet.

Deadline tasks are defaulty tagged with the lowest priority.

==== Module Tasks

===== Adding Module Tasks: `moduleTask`

- Schedules a module task, this module task includes priority level, module that is associated with the task.

- Format: `taskAdd desc/DESCRIPTION m/MODULE_CODE date/DD-MM-YYYY PRI/PRIORITY-LEVEL`

.Adding Module Tasks
image::moduleTaskAdd.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
This requires you to add a module under `moduleAdd` before you can use it

.Main Screen for profile tab
image::ProfileMainScreen.png[width="790"]

==== Adding a module : `moduleAdd`

- Adds a module you have taken before or is taking now and store your grade for each module if you want.

- Format: `moduleAdd m/MODULE_CODE [g/GRADE]`

[TIP]
The grade field is optional. You can state your grade when you add in modules and
also can update or add in your grade later.

****
* You can only add in modules which are valid modules that can be taken in NUS.
* All other module codes inputted will be considered as invalid and the program will not allow you to add in.
* This requirement is not case sensitive, which means for example, both "CS2103" and "cs2103" are considered valid module code.
****

[TIP]
The program checks whether a module code provided is valid or not by using the search function in module planning feature, which fetch information about
modules online. If the search function fails to fetch any information, the module code will be treated as invalid.

- Example:
* `moduleAdd m/CS2103`
* `moduleAdd m/cs1101s g/A`

.Adding a module

****

[TIP]
You don't need to indicate the modular credits for each module when you add it in because the program will fetch that infomation online.

.View current CAP
image::Cap.png[width="790"]

=== Profile / Module Book (Part 2: Manage your tasks separately for each module)

Most of the functionality here has been integrate into the Calendar feature but these commands left here still can be used.
You can give it a try if you want.

[NOTE]
These tasks related to certain module are called 'module task' from now on.

[TIP]
All commands that make changes to the module tasks will be synchronous for both module book and the task list in calendar feature.

[IMPORTANT]
For this part, the UI hasn't been implemented yet but you are able to see the updated list of module tasks in command line.

[IMPORTANT]
Most functionality covered in this part can also be achieved by some commands in Calendar feature above. Just provides users
with an alternative way. (The orders of tasks shown are different. Thus, the index inputted may be different to achieve the same modification.)

==== Creating a module task : `moduleTask`

[NOTE]
This command has been covered in Calendar feature already.

- Adds a module task related to certain module you have added before in module book.

- You need to indicate which module the task is related to, its priority level (how important it is) and also its deadline or scheduled timing.

- Format: `moduleTask desc/DESCRIPTION m/MODULE_CODE date/DEADLINE_OR_SCHEDULED_TIMING pri/PRIORITY`

[CAUTION]
The date inputted should be in the format: DD-MM-YYYY.

****
* This command allows you to create tasks to certain module you added to the program before.
* Stores the task added in the module book and automatically adds and shows on the Calender.
* You will get an updated list of tasks related to that specific module after adding. (shown in command line)
****
- Example:
* `moduleTask desc/essay m/CS2101 date/02-04-2020 pri/3` +
Add a module task as specified in module book and also shows on calendar.

.Adding a module task for certain module

==== Listing all module tasks of certain module

[TIP]
You can also view module tasks in calendar using `findModule m/MODULE_CODE`

- Lists all module tasks related to the specific module.

- Format: `listModuleTasks MODULE_CODE`

****
* Lists all module tasks related to that module in *CLI*.
* Module code inputted must be valid module code you have added in before.
****

- Example:
* `listModuleTasks CS2103` +
Lists all module tasks of CS2103.

.Showing all module tasks related to specified module
image::ListModuleTask.png[width="790"]

==== Deleting a module task : `taskDelete`

- Deletes the specified module tasks for certain module from the module book and calendar.

- Format: `taskDelete m/MODULE_CODE index/INDEX`

[NOTE]
This command is similar to the `taskDelete` command in Calendar feature but you need to specify the module code.

****
* Deletes the module task at the specified INDEX.
* The index refers to the index number *shown in the CLI* (you can get that by entering 'listModuleTasks MODULE_CODE')
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …
****

[CAUTION]
Only refer to the index of tasks shown in command line when performing this command. (not the one in calendar)

- Example:
* `taskDelete m/CS2103 index/1` +
Deletes the first module task for CS2103 in module book and Calendar. +
*(First task in module book and may not be the first in Calendar even after performing `findTask m/cs2103`)*
