By: `Team Notably`      Since: `Feb 2020`      Licence: `MIT`

== Introduction

Notably is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing notes*. More importantly, Notably is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Notably can get your notes taken down faster than traditional GUI apps.

=== An Introduction to Notably
The image shown below highlights the different sections of Notably's user interface:

.Notably GUI legends

=== Symbols used in this guide
[NOTE]
Denotes something that you may want to take note of.
[TIP]
Denotes something that may be helpful if you are having any difficulties.
[WARNING]
Denotes a warning for something critical.

== Getting started

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `notably.jar`
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your notes.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Application should start in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

== Features

====
*Command Legend*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `open NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `open Notably`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `open [-t] TITLE` can be used as `open -t TITLE` or as `open TITLE`, where `TITLE` is the title of the note.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `new -t TITLE [-o]`, `new [-o] -t TITLE` is also acceptable.
====
// tag::paths[]
[#paths]
====
*Paths*

* `Paths` are used to specify the directory you want `Commands` to be executed.
* There are 2 types of  `Path` namely:
- AbsolutePath (which takes reference from the root)
- RelativePath (which takes reference from the current directory)

The Relative Path operates similarly to the command line input that you may be familiar with.
Listed below are the notations used to define a relative path.

* `..` (Move to parent note)
* `exampleNote` (Move to child node titled "exampleNote")

[NOTE]
The title of a Note can take in alphanumeric variables, symbols (except ` and -) and spaces.

**Example**

The picture below helps to illustrate the use of `RelativePath` and `AbsolutePath`

.DataStructure example to illustrate Path
image::PathExample1.png[width="790"]

The `AbsolutePath` `/CS2101` is equivalent to `RelativePath` `../CS2101`

Thus `open /CS2101` and `open ../CS2101` would yield the same result.

[NOTE]
Paths are used by the `open` and `delete` command

[WARNING]
We cannot open or delete the parent of the root note because it does not exist. e.g `Delete /../` will result in an error.
// end::paths[]
====
[[Markdown]]
====
*Markdown*

* Notably supports basic GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) in the `BODY` content of a note
* Currently supported syntax of GitHub Flavored Markdown in Notably consists of:
** https://github.github.com/gfm/#atx-heading[ATX headings]
** https://github.github.com/gfm/#paragraph[Paragraphs]
** (Ordered list coming in v2.0) https://github.github.com/gfm/#list[Lists] and https://github.github.com/gfm/#list-items[List items]
** (Coming in v2.0) https://github.github.com/gfm/#emphasis-and-strong-emphasis[Emphasis and strong emphasis (Simplified)]
** (Coming in v2.0) https://github.github.com/gfm/#strikethrough-extension-[Strikethrough]
* Specifications for GFM are specified https://github.github.com/gfm/[here]

[NOTE]
The term `Markdown` as used in this document will be a shorthand for GitHub Flavored Markdown. However, it is worth noting that by definition, they are not the same.

====

=== View help : `help`

If you can't remember the commands or you are unsure about what a particular command does, type `help` and hit kbd:[Enter].
Figure 3 below shows you what this will look like on your screen.

*Format:* `help`

.Demo for the `help` command
image::demo/Help1.png[]


You will then see a Help window on your screen, as seen in Figure 4 below, which will include a summary of the commands and a link to Notably's User Guide. +

.Demo for the `help` command (continued)
image::demo/Help2.png[]

[TIP]
====
* While the help window is open, you can hold the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] keys to scroll through it's contents. This is
a more efficient solution than using your mouse!
====

=== Exit the program: `exit`

If you're done with taking notes, use `exit` to close Notably straight from the command line. +

*Format:* `exit`

.Demo for the `exit` command
image::demo/Exit.png[]

=== Create a new note: `new`

If you want to add a new note to the current working directory (currently opened note), use the `new` command and specify the `TITLE` of the note. +

*Format:* `new -t TITLE [-o]`

[IMPORTANT]
====
* The `TITLE` for the note MUST be specified.
* The `TITLE` for the note can only contain alphabets, numbers, symbols (except ` and -) and whitespaces.
====

[TIP]
====
* Use the optional `-o` flag to immediately open the note after creating it.
====

==== Example: Creating new notes
. Let's first create a note (with a `TITLE`), and open it immediately after. <<New1, (Step 1)>> Type this command: +

    new -t Notably -o


. Now the currently open note is `Notably`. Let's add create a note to the currently opened note, <<New2, (Step 2)>> with a `TITLE` only as follows: +

    new -t CS2103T

. The new note `CS2103T` has been created successfully! <<New3, (Step 3)>> +

[NOTE]
====
Observe that the note `CS2103T` was not opened immediately
====

[[New3]]
.Step 3 - Demo for the `new` command (after creating both notes)

=== Open an existing note: `open`

You can open an existing note by specifying its title (and optionally with its absolute or relative <<paths, path>>). +

*Format:* `open [-t] [RelativePath/AbsolutePath]TITLE` +

[TIP]
====
* If you want to save some keypresses, omit the optional `-t` flag. It still works fine!
====

==== Example: Opening a note
. Let's open the note `Notably` that exists in the currently opened note `Workspace` <<Open, (Step 1)>> with the command: +

    open -t Notably

[NOTE]
====
* Notably gives you some useful suggestions on other paths that are similar or related to your input!
====
[[Open]]
.Step 1 - Demo for the `open` command (with suggestions)
image::demo/Open.png[]

=== Edit an existing note: `edit`

If you want to change the `BODY` content of the currently opened note, use the `edit` command. This command *opens* an editing window where you can update the existing `BODY` of the note.
*Format:* `edit`

[WARNING]
====
* You are not allowed to `edit` the root note, i.e the currently opened path is ``"/"``
====

==== Example: Editing the currently opened note
. Let's update the `BODY` content of the currently opened note `Workspace` with the command: +

    edit

.Demo for the `edit` command
image::demo/Edit.png[]

=== Delete a note: `delete`

If you no longer need a note, or you accidentally created a wrong note, don't worry! You can always delete that
note (and optionally by specifying its absolute or relative <<paths, path>>). +

*Format:* `delete [-t] [RelativePath/AbsolutePath]TITLE`

[WARNING]
====
* Deleting a note will also delete its child notes. Be very careful! You can refer to the example below for an illustration
====

==== Example: Deleting an existing note
. Let's delete the `Notably` note using this command:

    delete -t Notably

[NOTE]
====
* `Another Note`, `CS2103` and `ST2334` are immediately deleted as well since they are child notes of `Notably`
* The above example uses `RelativePath`. You can achieve the same result as above by using an `AbsolutePath` instead by executing `delete -t /Workspace/Notably`.

=== Find a note based on certain keywords: `search`

If you need to look for a note that contain a specific keyword, use the `search` command and Notably when show you the result sorted by the number of matches in the note.  +
*Format:* `search [-s] KEYWORD`

[NOTE]
====
* `search` looks through *all* the notes that you have
* Partial matches work as well!
* Matches are case insensitive, meaning it will find the word no matter if it is in uppercase or lowercase or even mixed-case
====

==== Example: Searching for the keyword "Computer science"
. Let's look through all the notes that we have saved, for the keyword "Computer science" +

search -s Computer science

.Demo for the `search` command
image::demo/Search.png[]

=== Save the data

Notes data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need for you to save manually.

=== Auto suggestions

As you type, Notably will provide you suggestions. You can then press kbd:[Enter] to select the first suggestion.

.Demo for the suggestions feature
image::demo/Suggestions.png[]

==== (Coming in v2.0) Suggestion response text when opening or deleting a parent note
Variations of path with `../` (e.g. `open ../`, `open Note/../Note`, etc.) will not generate a comprehensive response text.
Currently, typing `open ../` will generate a response text of `Open a note titled "../"` instead of `Open a parent note`.

=== Auto correct

Even if you mistype, Notably tries its best to correct the typo automatically, as long as the mistyped input command is not too far away from Notably's available commands. This provides you with a more fluid typing experience.

.Demo for the auto-correction feature
