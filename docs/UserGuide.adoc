== Introduction (Xinwei)



=== An Introduction to NUSProductivity User guide

- NUSProductivity is an application designed for all NUS students to better manage their school work. The app is set out to enhance your productivity in school through 5 main features, module planning, CAP (cumulative average point) tracking, note taking, deadline and task listing, and finally, diary logging. This app is designed only for NUS students for now with the possibility to customise it for students from other universities in the future. More importantly, NUSProductivity is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Read on to get you started on using the application!

- The purpose of this document is for you to familiarise yourself with the functions and capabilities of what NUSProductivity can do.

- The image below shows the different parts of the user interface of NUSProductivity

// tag::Calendar[]

=== Calendar (Xinwei)

The calendar feature in the app that allows you to schedule and set deadline for important tasks such as project or assignment deadlines.

The application allows you to add 2 type of tasks, `deadline` and `moduleTask`.

`moduleTask` allows you to tag a module, that you have already inputted in your Profile tab, to the task itself. It allows you to set the priority level of the task.

`deadline` allows you to input a deadline event into the calendar without any specified modules attached to it.

==== Priority Levels

We give you the flexibility to choose and indicate what priority each `moduleTask` should have. This priority is represented from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest priority and 5 being the highest.

.NUSProductivity calendar priority levels
image::prioritylevels.png[width="790"]


==== Deadline

===== Adding Deadline: `deadlineAdd`

- Schedules a task tagged with a deadline to the calendar. A dot will be shown to indicate there is a deadline to be met on that day

- Format: `deadlineAdd desc/DESCRIPTION by/DD-MM-YYYY cat/CATEGORY`

.Adding Deadlines
image::deadlineAdd.png[width="790"]

After invoking the command, the deadline will be added to the calendar as shown in figure 5. The task will be tagged as light grey to signify it is uncompleted yet.

Deadline tasks are defaulty tagged with the lowest priority.

==== Module Tasks （Wangkai)

==== Adding a module task : `moduleTask`

- Format: `moduleTask desc/DESCRIPTION m/MODULE_CODE date/DEADLINE_OR_SCHEDULED_TIMING pri/PRIORITY`

[CAUTION]
The date inputted should be in the format: DD-MM-YYYY.

****
* This command allows you to create tasks to certain module you added to the program before.
* Stores the task added in the module book and automatically adds and shows on the Calender.
* You will get an updated list of tasks related to that specific module after adding. (shown in command line)
****
- Example:
* `moduleTask desc/essay m/CS2101 date/02-04-2020 pri/3` +
Add a module task as specified in module book and also shows on calendar.

.Adding a module task for certain module

****
* You can only add in modules which are valid modules that can be taken in NUS.
* All other module codes inputted will be considered as invalid and the program will not allow you to add in.
* This requirement is not case sensitive, which means for example, both "CS2103" and "cs2103" are considered valid module code.
****

[TIP]
The program checks whether a module code provided is valid or not by using the search function in module planning feature, which fetch information about
modules online. If the search function fails to fetch any information, the module code will be treated as invalid.

- Example:

=== Profile / Module Book (Part 2: Manage your tasks separately for each module) (Wangkai)

Most of the functionality here has been integrate into the Calendar feature but these commands left here still can be used.
You can give it a try if you want.

[NOTE]
These tasks related to certain module are called 'module task' from now on.

[TIP]
All commands that make changes to the module tasks will be synchronous for both module book and the task list in calendar feature.

[IMPORTANT]
For this part, the UI hasn't been implemented yet but you are able to see the updated list of module tasks in command line.

[IMPORTANT]
Most functionality covered in this part can also be achieved by some commands in Calendar feature above. Just provides users
with an alternative way. (The orders of tasks shown are different. Thus, the index inputted may be different to achieve the same modification.)



==== Listing all module tasks of certain module

[TIP]
You can also view module tasks in calendar using `findModule m/MODULE_CODE`

- Lists all module tasks related to the specific module.

- Format: `listModuleTasks MODULE_CODE`

* Deletes the module task at the specified INDEX.
* The index refers to the index number *shown in result display panel* (you can get that by entering 'listModuleTasks MODULE_CODE')
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …
****

[CAUTION]
Only refer to the index of tasks shown in command line when performing this command. (not the one in calendar)

- Example:
* `taskDelete m/CS2103 index/1` +
Deletes the first module task for CS2103 in module book and Calendar. +
*(First task in module book and may not be the first in Calendar even after performing `findTask m/cs2103`)*

.Deleting a module task
image::TaskDeleteWirhModuleCode.png[width="790"]

==== Marking a module task as done : `done`

- Marks the specified module tasks for certain module as done in the module book and calendar.

== FAQ
*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous fitness log book folder.

*Q*: How do I save my data in my own PC? +
*A*: NusProductivity saves your data of all your modules, grades and tasks after you make changes.

*Q*: Do I need Internet connection when using NUSProductivity? +
*A*: Although we try to keep NUSProductivity as an offline application, some minimal network connection is required for the first time usage of certain features such as `moduleAdd` and `search`. However, only the first time searching for a module information is required as the results will be cached in our application to allow no Internet connection for future usage.
