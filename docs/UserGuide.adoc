== Introduction

CardiBuddy (CardiB) is for students who *prefer to use a desktop app to store their revision materials as flashcards*. More importantly, CardiB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CardiB can help you to store revision materials quickly. The self-testing features will definitely help you to ace your examinations as opposed to traditional ways of revision by re-reading lecture notes. Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `cardibuddy.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your CardiBuddy.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all decks
* **`add`**`d/CS1101S t/Basics` : adds an empty deck titled `CS1101S` to the CardiBuddy.
* *`open 1`* : opens the 1st deck shown in the current list
* **`delete deck`**`3` : deletes the 3rd deck shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Application-specific Terminologies*

* *Decks* are the containers that contain the flashcard. A flashcard can only exist in a deck.
* *Flashcards* are cards that contain revision materials, specifically a question and an answer.
* *Test Session* emulates how you would test yourself with a deck of flashcards in real life. You get to view each flashcard in a chosen deck one by one, question first. Once you have decided on your answer to it, you can 'flip' the flashcard and see the answer. See <<Testing, here>> for more details on using test sessions.
* *Statistics* is the numerical, summarized version of your data, based on your test history. Your statistics can serve as a guideline for you to decide which areas you need to work on, and which areas you are familiar with.


*Common Terminologies*

* *File path* specifies the unique location of a file in a file system from the root directory.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add d/TITLE`, `TITLE` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/CS1101S`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `d/TITLE [t/TAG]` can be used as `d/CS1101S t/Basics` or as `d/CS1101S`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Easy`, `t/Easy t/Basics` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `d/TITLE t/TAG`, `t/TAG d/TITLE` is also acceptable.

*Special Icons*

* :bulb: is used to signal information that is helpful for the users to know.

=== Testing
==== Overview
Of course, you did not create all those decks and flashcards just so you can admire them! It's time to get your revision on. Start a `test session` for a deck to begin testing yourself!

A `test session` works just like how flashcard testing works in real life - You look at the question, think of the answer, and 'flip' the card around to see if your answer matches the one on the flashcard.

The difference here is that you do not need to manually keep track of how many flashcards you got right and wrong -- CardiBuddy does all that for you!

In addition, you will also get to see a summary of how you've done at the end of your `test session`.

==== Retesting
A `test session` in CardiBuddy is special - it includes a *retesting* feature to make sure you know your content well.

When you answer a flashcard's question wrongly, you will encounter it again later on in the same `test session`. There is no need to do this manually - CardiBuddy does this for you too.

Hence if you keep getting a question wrong, a `test session` can go on and on forever - unless you finally get it right, or you manually quit the `test session`!

==== Starting a test session for a deck: `test INDEX`
To start your `test session`, replace `INDEX` with the index number of the deck you wish to test. This number will be to the _left_ of the title of your deck, when you are viewing all your decks as a list.

What this command does:

* A test session will immediately replace the normal deck and flashcard list view.
* The first question of the test session will be shown to you.

Example Usage:

* `test 1` +
Creates a test session for the 1st deck.

==== To answer the question: `ans YOUR_ANSWER`
Replace `YOUR ANSWER` with your answer to the displayed question.

What this command does:

* Submits your answer, and checks your answer against the flashcard's stored answer
* Displays the result of your answer (CORRECT or WRONG)
* Displays your answer and the flashcard's answer

Example Usage:

* `ans CardiBuddy` +
To answer the question: "What is the name of this application?"

==== Don't want to answer? Skip a question with: `skip`
What this command does:

* If you already know the answer to the question, and don't want to waste your time answering it, just type `skip` to go to the next question.
* Your skipped flashcard will not impact your overall test score, and CardiBuddy will merely remove it from your current test session.

Note:

* You can use this command if either:
** You have not answered the question.
** You have answered the question, but you got it wrong.
* CardiBuddy will not let you use `skip` if you have already gotten that question correct.


==== To force your wrong answer to be marked as correct: `force`

What this command does:

* CardiBuddy's uses automated marking to mark your answers. It takes your answer _word for word_ when checking against the model answer stored in your flashcard.
* If your answer differs from the model answer, it will be marked as wrong.
* After submitting your answer, you will get to see the model answer and your answer, for you to compare them.
* If you feel that your answer still meets the question's requirements, you can `force` your answer to be marked as correct.

==== To go to the next question: `next`

What this command does:

* After submitting your answer, type `next` to go to the next question (if there are any left to test).

Note:

* You can only type `next` once you have submitted your answer.

==== Quit the test session halfway: `quit`

What this command does:

* Allows you to quit the current test session even before it is completed.

=== Displaying History

=== Detecting duplicates

==== Detecting duplicate deck

Upon adding a new deck, the application automatically checks if there are any existing decks with the same title. Only decks with unique titles can be successfully added.

==== Detecting duplicate card

Upon adding a new card to a specific deck, the application automatically checks if there are any existing cards with the same question in that deck. Only cards with unique questions can be successfully added.

If there is a card with the same question but it is in a different deck, the card can still be successfully added.

{empty} +

=== Statistics

* Shows the number of Decks/Cards created and deleted, number of Test Sessions played, average correct percentage, average number of tries for each question.
* Includes a line graph of the history of test previous test results.


==== Displaying all statistics: `statistics`

Displays the statistics across all decks.
