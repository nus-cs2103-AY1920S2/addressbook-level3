== Introduction
This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the Delino desktop application:
quick start guide, features, FAQ, command summary, and glossary.

Delino is for couriers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their delivery tasks*.
It is *optimised for those who have a strong preference towards Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still enjoying the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Sounds interesting? Have a quick look at our tutorial <<Quick Start>> to get started.
Have a delightful journey using Delino!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `Delino.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Delino.
