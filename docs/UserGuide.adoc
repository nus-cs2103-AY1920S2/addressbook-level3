maximise your time to get as much fun as you can amidst your hectic work schedule. In fact, it aims to help you be the
best friend that you can ever be!

Naggy Joel is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their social life*. It is an application that
allows a user to manage all aspects of their social life, ranging from their different social circles and contacts,
to their events and deadlines, as well as, places to hang out and potential practical gifts that will be very much
appreciated by the recipient.  More importantly, Naggy Joel is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command
