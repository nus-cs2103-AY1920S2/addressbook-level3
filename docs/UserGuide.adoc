== Introduction

*HireLah!* is a productivity app that helps busy interviewers like you manage multiple interview sessions in an orderly
manner. During each interview session, *HireLah!* helps you to keep track of interviewee information and interview
rubrics in one central location so that you can focus on what's important - the interview itself!
{empty} +
{empty} +

*HireLah!* has the following main features:

. Manage multiple interview sessions, one for each different job position you are conducting interview for.
. Add and modify interview rubrics for each interview session, including:
.. A list of attributes you want to look out for in an interviewee.
.. A set of questions that you would like to ask all interviewees.
.. A collection of metrics to score interviewees, allowing you to easily rank potential candidates.
. Record your remarks for an interviewee during an interview, and score the interviewee based on the attributes.
. Identify the best interviewees based on particular attributes or metrics, so that you can follow up with them.
. Export interview transcripts for future reference.

{empty} +

*HireLah!* is optimised for interviewers who are fast typists and prefer typing over other means of input. It comes with:

* A Command Line Interface (CLI) which allows you to access all *HireLah!* features by typing.
* A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that displays the information you need to conduct an interview, with limited GUI
convenience features.

== About this Guide

=== Basic Information
This User Guide explains how you can use *HireLah!* to help you manage your interviews.

.*LEFT* List of all interviewees, *RIGHT* List of best interviewees.
image::Screenshots/IntervieweeVSBestInterviewee.png[width="500"]

Each interviewee card contains the full name, ID and alias of the interviewee. It also shows whether the
interviewee has had uploaded a resume (indicated by a green circle with a tick beside "Resume:") and the interview
status of the interviewee (white circle indicates the interviewee has not been interviewed, yellow circle indicates
that interview with this interviewee is currently underway/incomplete, green circle indicates that the interview with
this interviewee has been completed).

In addition, if the list of best interviewees is being shown, the score of each interviewee based on the ranking
criteria will be displayed on each interviewee's card.

==== Transcript Panel
Transcript Panel displays the interview transcript of an interviewee. It consists of two sub-components:

* A Detailed Interviewee Card on the left, which contains:
  . Full name, ID and alias of the interviewee.
  . A button that opens the interviewee's resume.
  . A table showing the score assigned to the interviewee for each attribute that this interview looks out for. If an
attribute has not been scored yet, the score will be shown as "-".

* A Remarks List showing the time-stamped remarks entered by the user about the interviewee during the interview. The
list also contains question headers, indicating that the remarks entered after it are in response to the interviewee's
answer to the particular question.

// tag::FeaturesIntro[]
== Features

Generally, in an interview session (for example, an interview for a role in a company), there are 3 phases:

. Initialization phase (or preparation phase) - where the interviewer prepares his/her questions, manages
  candidates, receives their resumes, etc.
. Interview phase - where the interviewer actually conducts interviews, asking questions and
  making notes about each candidate
. Decision phase - after interviewing all candidates, the interviewer summarises his/her opinions, refers
  to the remarks he/she made of each interviewee and decides who to select

These 3 phases are clearly defined in *HireLah!*. What you can do in each phase is listed below.

=== Viewing help

*Command*

You never know when you need to refer to this guide. For that reason, the helpful `help` command is available
always within the app, except during an interview, where "help" may be a remark you want to make about the current
candidate being interviewed! Still, the help command is always accessible via the kbd:[F1] key, or by clicking the
"Help" button on the top of the menu.

....
help
....

_Action:_ This user guide is opened as a PDF with your system's default PDF viewer.

=== Exiting the App

Similar to help, `exit` is always available to close the app, except during an interview (Why would you want
to close the app during an interview?).

*Command*

....
exit
....

_Action:_ The app exits.
// end::FeaturesIntro[]


// tag::session[]
=== Managing Sessions

*HireLah!* allows you to clearly separate your interview sessions. After all, it would be disastrous to mix up your candidates
for one job with the candidates for a totally different role, or ask the wrong questions to the wrong person!

==== New Session

When you first start the app, there will be no existing sessions. You can create a new session to get started via the `new` command.

[TIP]
Sessions are stored as directories in a `/data` directory HireLah! creates in the same location as the app. To make sure
session names are valid, we only allow Alphanumeric characters (a, b, c or 1, 2, 3) and spaces (but not all spaces!). +
Do not accidentally delete this folder! *HireLah!* will not be able to restore your data if you delete it!

*Command*

....
new <session name>
....

*Execution Example*

....
> new ceo interview
....

_Action:_ Creates a new session called "ceo interview" and opens the session.

image::Screenshots/NewSession.png[]

==== Open and Close Sessions

On subsequent uses of *HireLah!*, you will be greeted at the starting screen with all the sessions you have
created. You can choose to start a new session again, or open a previous session to continue working in it using the
`open` command. After you are done for the day, or need to switch to another session, simply close the session with the
`close session` command. Closing a session will naturally return you to the starting screen where you can open or create new
sessions.

*Commands*

....
open <session name>
close session
....

==== Delete Session

After a long time, old sessions may not be relevant anymore. To clear space for new interviews, use the `delete` command.

*Command*

....
delete <session name>
....

*Execution Example*

....
> delete ceo interview
....

_Action:_ Deletes the ceo interview session and all its data.

_Output:_

....
Successfully deleted the session: ceo interview
....
// end::session[]

=== Initialization Phase

// tag::interviewees[]
==== Add, Edit and Delete Interviewees

*HireLah!* allows you to manage your list of candidates from within the app. You can add interviewees to the list
by giving their full name, and *HireLah!* automatically generates a unique ID for each candidate. To make things easier,
you can also specify an alias (a shorter name) to the interviewee, so you need not memorise their IDs or type out their
full names every time.

Whenever you see `<interviewee>`, it means that you can specify the interviewee you are referring to via any of his/her
unique identifiers - ID, full name or alias.

At any time you can delete any interviewees and edit their information.

[TIP]
Most names and aliases are accepted - even non-English names or names with funny punctuation and numbers (eg. Larry O'Brien the 3rd).
Your interviewees could come from anywhere after all. But do not give blanks or a name full of numbers (eg. 12345)!

[TIP]
If you are adding an interviewee with an alias, but you accidentally give an invalid alias (the same as another interviewee's name or alias)
*HireLah!* does what it can - it adds the interviewee, but tells you that it failed to add the alias. +
If you are editing an interviewee and specify both a new name and new alias, if either are invalid, *HireLah!* will prevent you from performing that action!

*Commands*

....
add interviewee <full name> [-aka <alias>]
edit interviewee <interviewee> [-n <new full name>] [-aka <new alias>]
delete interviewee <interviewee>
....

*Execution Example*

....
> add interviewee Jane Doe -aka Doe
> edit interviewee Jane Doe -n Janice Doe -aka JDoe
> delete interviewee Janice Doe
....

_Action:_ Interviewee Jane Doe with alias of Doe is first created and
then her name is changed to Janice Doe.

_Output:_

....
New interviewee added: Jane Doe

Edited interviewee: Jane Doe

Deleted interviewee: Janice Doe
....

image::Screenshots/Interviewee.png[]
{empty} +

==== Upload Resume

Interviewer can upload a resume for a specific interviewee. If the path is specified,
the resume will be uploaded from the specified path. Otherwise, it will open a file-picker.

[TIP]
*HireLah!* does *NOT* copy the file you upload! It merely remembers the location of the resume.
If you delete or move the file, *HireLah!* can no longer open the resume! +
We recommend that you organize all the resumes in a folder, perhaps next to the `/data` directory.

*Command*

....
upload <interviewee> [-p <path>]
....

*Execution Example*

....
> upload Jane Doe
....

_Action:_ Resume is selected by the user via a file-picker window and then uploaded for the interviewee Jane Doe.

_Output after selecting the resume file:_

....
Successfully added the resume!
....

image::Screenshots/Upload.png[]
{empty} +

==== Open Resume

Interviewer can open a resume from a specific interviewee.

[WARNING]
Note: Make sure you have a default app for viewing PDF files, or whatever format your resumes are in!
*HireLah!* tries to open the file you give as a resume, but if your system does not know how to open the file,
*HireLah!* will not be able to help! As far as *HireLah!* is concerned, it has successfully performed its job
to request your system to open the file.

*Command*

....
resume Jane Doe
....

_Action:_ Jane Doe's resume is opened.

_Output:_

....
Resume of Jane Doe opened.
....
{empty} +
// end::interviewees[]

[[Attributes]]
// tag::attributes[]
==== Add, Edit and Delete Attributes

In an interview, you often look out for a particular set of attributes in your candidates.
*HireLah!* lets you keep track of what to look out for during the interview, and even assign
scores for each attribute to the interviewees so you can compare them after interviewing.

[TIP]
An attribute's name can only contain alphabets and spaces, and it should not be blank!

*Command*

....
> add attribute <attribute>
> edit attribute <old attribute> -a <new attribute>
> delete attribute <attribute>
....

*Execution Example*

....
> add attribute teamwork
> add attribute leadersip
> edit attribute leadersip -a leadership
> delete attribute teamwork
....

_Action:_ teamwork and leadersip is first added. leadersip (with a typo) is edited
to leadership, and then teamwork is deleted.

_Output:_

....
New attribute added: teamwork

New attribute added: leadersip

Edited attribute: leadersip to leadership

Deleted attribute: teamwork
....

{empty} +
// end::attributes[]

// tag::questions[]
==== Add, Edit and Delete Interview Questions

Before the interview process, the interviewer may wish to review the
questions. During review process before the commencement of interviews, the interviewer may want to add more
questions, remove unnecessary questions or modify existing questions.

*Command*

....
add question <question description>
edit question <question number> -q <edited question>
delete question <question number>
....

*Example*

....
> add question What are your relevant experiences?
> add question What are your strengths?
> edit question 1 -q What do you hope to accomplish in 5 years?
> edit question 2 -q How can you add value to the company?
> delete question 1
....

_Action:_ The question "What are your relevant experiences?" will be added first, followed by the question "What are
your strengths?". Then, question 1 and 2 are edited, before question 1 is deleted.

_Output:_

....
New question added: What are your relevant experiences?

New question added: What are your strengths?

Edited question 1 to What do you hope to accomplish in 5 years?

Edited question 2 to How can you add value to the company?

Deleted question: What do you hope to accomplish in 5 years?
....

image::Screenshots/Question.png[]
{empty} +

// end::questions[]

//tag::load[]
==== Load Attributes and Questions from other Session
In case of having multiple sessions with the same attributes and questions. There is a `load` command
to load attributes and questions from other session. Therefore, there is no extra work to do.

*Command*

....
load attributes <session>
load questions <session>
....

*Example*

....
> load attributes ceo
> load questions janitor
....

_Output:_

....
Loaded attributes from ceo

Loaded questions from janitor
....

image::Screenshots/Load.png[]
{empty} +
// end::load[]

// tag::view[]
==== Switching views

When working on the attributes, questions and metrics (more about metrics in <<Metrics>>),
*HireLah!* displays the relevant content you are working on on the right side of the application.
To switch views between them, *HireLah!* also provides these commands.

*Command*

....
attributes
questions
metrics
....

_Action:_ Switches between displaying attributes, questions and metrics.

_Output:_

....
Here is the list of attributes:

Here is the list of questions:

Here is the list of metrics:
....
{empty} +
{empty} +
On the left side of the application, all of the interviewees are listed. It will switch to only show several
best interviewees when the the command is entered by the user. To switch back to list down the interviewees, HireLah!
provides this command.

*Command*

....
interviewees
....

_Action:_ Displays the interviewee list.

_Output:_

....
Here is the list of interviewees:
....
{empty} +

// end::view[]

// tag::finalise[]
==== Finalise Interview Attributes and Questions

After the interviewer is satisfied with the list of questions and attributes created for an interview session, the
interviewer must finalise changes in attributes and questions. This is to ensure that the interviewers will evaluate all
interviewees fairly and equally using the same set of questions and attributes.

[WARNING]
Finalise is *irreversible*! Make sure you are sure of the attributes and questions you have, since *HireLah!* will
not allow you to make changes to them after giving this command. This may seem restrictive, but this consistency will
give you guarantees that make *HireLah!* really useful. For example, later on, if you open someone's interview report and
find his/her answer to a question, then go to another report and view the same question, you are guaranteed that both interviewees
were asked the same thing!

*Command*

....
finalise
....

_Output:_

....
Attributes and questions of this interview session has been finalised. You cannot change them anymore.
....

image::Screenshots/Finalise.png[]
{empty} +

// end::finalise[]

// tag::interviewPhase[]

=== Interview Phase

==== Start Interview

After finalising, you can start to interview the interviewees.

*Command*

....
interview <interviewee>
....

*Example*

....
> interview Jane Doe
....

_Action:_ Initializes an interview session with Jane. The app
also starts the interview time.

_Output:_

....
Interview with Jane Doe started!
....

image::Screenshots/Interview.png[]
{empty} +

==== Record Remarks

After starting the interview, *HireLah!* allows you to easily take notes within the app itself.
Anything you type in the Command Box, will be recorded as interview remarks, which are timestamped, allowing you to
easily navigate your interview remarks after the interview is over.

*Command*

....
<remarks>
....

*Example*

....
> Interesting family history, all of her family members are very rich.
....

_Action:_ Stores this remark and maps it to the specific time when you
enter it.

_Output:_

....
Added the remark.
....

image::Screenshots/Remark.png[]
{empty} +

==== Asking Questions

Special commands while interviewing are prefixed with a ":". These commands are
not recorded as remarks and instead perform special actions.

The start question command allows you to indicate when you asked a question during
the interview. This allows you to easily navigate to relevant parts of the interview
after the interview ends, while viewing the report.

*Command*

....
:start q<question number>
....

*Example*

....
> :start q1
> Strengths: resilience, ambitious, good time-management
> Weakness: perfectionist, not detail-oriented
> Short answers

....

_Output:_

....
Marked the start of question 1

Added the remark

Added the remark

Added the remark

....

_Action:_ Marks the start of question 1, then adds some remarks related to question 1.

image::Screenshots/StartQuestion.png[]
{empty} +

==== Score attributes

During the interview, as you form your opinion on the candidate, you can give them scores for the
attributes you have created earlier (see <<Attributes>>).

[TIP]
To keep things sensible, HireLah! allows you to give a score from between 0 to 10 inclusive. So
9.6 and 0.2 are in, but don't try and give someone -10!

*Command*

....
:set <attribute> <score>
....

*Example*

....
> :set leadership 5
....

_Action:_ update the leadership score for John Doe (displayed in a table).

_Output:_

....
Scored 5.00 to leadership
....

image::Screenshots/AttributeScore.png[]
{empty} +

==== Other Viewing Commands

During the interview, only a small subset of the usual commands are available by placing ":" in front.
It would be terrible if you accidentally deleted an interviewee while interviewing him/her! However, it is
important to be able to look at the current interviewee's resume, and look at the attributes and questions
needed in the interview, thus these viewing operations are supported.

*Command*

....
:resume
:questions
:attributes
:metrics
....

*Example*

....
> :resume
> :questions
....

_Action:_ Opens the resume of the current interviewee. Then switches the tab to show the questions.

_Output:_

....
Resume of John Doe opened.

Here is the list of questions:
....
{empty} +

==== End interview

After finishing the interview, give the end command. After the interview has ended,
you will not be allowed to make any more remarks or change the interviewee's scores.
Don't end prematurely!

[TIP]
*HireLah!* will not allow you to end the interview if you have not assigned a score
on all the attributes!

*Command*

....
:end
....

*Example*

....
> end
....

_Action:_ Ending the interview session.

_Output_:

....
Ended interview with Jane Doe.
....

{empty} +

=== Decision Phase

// end::interviewPhase[]

// tag::open[]
==== Viewing Interviewee Reports
After interviewing a candidate, you can view the interview transcript any
time by doing an open command. To close the report, you can use a close command.

*Command
....

open <interviewee>
close report
....

*Example*

....
> open Jane Doe
....

_Action_: Shows the entire list of remarks made during the interview, with
their timestamps.

// end::open[]

// tag::export[]
==== Exporting Interviewee Reports to PDF

After interviewing a candidate, you can also export the report of the interviewee
in the form of a PDF.

*Command*

....
export <interviewee>
....

*Example*

....
> export Jane Doe
....

_Action_: Exports the interview report of a particular interviewee in PDF.

_Output_:

....
Report of Anna exported in /Users/jane/main with file name "2.pdf".
....

image::Screenshots/Export.png[]
// end::export[]

// tag::navigation[]
==== Working in an Interviewee Report

After opening a report, you can scroll up and down to navigate through
the remarks you made during the interview. In addition, you can zoom in
on a particular moment in the interview by question number, or by the
interview time.

===== Navigating by Question Number

Jumps to the point when the interviewee was
answering the given question (marked by the `:start q<question number>` command).

*Command*

....
goto q<question number>
....

*Example*

....
> goto q2
....

_Output_:

....
Here is the remark of question 2!
....

image::Screenshots/NavigationQuestion.png[]
{empty} +

===== Navigating by Timestamp

Scrolls the list of remarks to the given time.
The user can scroll up and down to see the rest of the remarks.

*Command*

....
goto <time>
....

*Example*

....
> goto 2.00
....

_Output_:

....
Here is the remark at time 2.00!
....

image::Screenshots/NavigationTime.png[]
{empty} +
// end::navigation[]

[[Metrics]]
// tag::metrics[]
==== Add, Edit and Delete Metrics

After the interview process, the interviewer may want to compare the interviewed interviewees by
creating a custom metric to determine the relative importance of several attributes. Each metric
assigns a weight to one or more Attributes, and interviewees can be ranked based on their score calculated by
this metric via the `best` command (see <<Find Best Candidates>>.

[TIP]
A metric's name can only contain alphabets and spaces, and it should not be blank!

*Command*

....
add metric <name> -a <attribute> -w <score> [-a <attribute> -w <score>]...
edit metric <name> [-n <metric name>] [-a <attribute> -w <score>]...
delete metric <name>
....

*Example*

....
> add metric extremeLeader -a leadership -w 0.7 -a tenacity -w 0.6
> edit metric extremeLeader -n extremeDictatorship -a leadership -w 3
> delete metric extremeDictatorship
> add metric extremeLeader -a leadership -w 0.7 -a tenacity -w 0.3
....

_Action:_ Adds a metric named extremeLeader with the scoring scheme
_Score = 0.7*leadership + 0.6*tenacity_. Then, the extremeLeader metric
name will be changed to extremeDictatorship with the weightage of leadership increased to 3.
Next it deletes extremeDictatorship, then adds the metric extremeLeader (again) with
a different scoring scheme _Score = 0.7*leadership + 0.3*tenacity_.

_Output:_

....
New metric added: extremeLeader

Edited metric: extremeLeader

Deleted metric: extremeDictatorship

New metric added: extremeLeader
....

image::Screenshots/Metric.png[]
// end::metrics[]

// tag::best[]
==== Find Best Candidates

After interviewing all the candidates, *HireLah!* can help you analyse the candidates and show
you who scored the best in the attributes you set. By default, *HireLah!* allows you to compare by:

. The candidates' average scores across all attributes.
. A single attribute (eg. find who scored the highest in leadership).
. Your own custom scoring metric (see <<Metrics>>).

[TIP]
Take note that *HireLah!* will only compare interviewees who have completed their interviews
(Those who you have successfully performed an `:end` command after interviewing). This is
to make sure all the compared candidates have been scored in all attributes.

[TIP]
In case there are ties in terms of the score, e.g. if we would like to retrieve the best 5 interviewees,
but the score is the same between the fifth and the sixth interviewees, both interviewees will be shown.

*Command*

....
interviewees -best <number of candidates> [-a <attribute>]
interviewees -best <number of candidates> [-m <metric>]
....

*Example*

....
interviewees -best 1
interviewees -best 2 -m extremeLeader
interviewees -best 3 -a leadership
....

_Action_: Firstly, *HireLah!* will show the top interviewee in overall score.
Then, it will show the top 2 interviewees based on the extremeLeader metric. Finally, it will
show the top 3 interviewees based on their leadership score.

_Output_:

....
Here are the best 1 interviewees.

Here are the best 2 interviewees.

Here are the best 3 interviewees.
....

image::Screenshots/Best.png[]
// end::best[]

== Advanced Features

// tag::prefix[]
=== Typing shortcuts - Prefix matching

It is often tedious to have to type out a long attribute like "Productivity"
or "Team Player". Especially during an interview, a typing mistake may cost you
precious time, possibly missing some important thing the interviewee said. HireLah!
thus allows you to simply type part (a prefix) of the full word, as long as it
uniquely identifies an attribute.

For example, if you have the following attributes:

* Leadership
* Ambition
* Team player
* Team motivator

{empty} +
Then:

* "L", "Le" or any longer prefix can uniquely identify "Leadership"
* "A" sufficiently identifies "Ambition"
* "Team" **cannot** identify "Team player" as "Team motivator" shares this prefix
* To minimally distinguish the 2, you must provide "Team p" or "Team m"

*HireLah!* also provides this convenient function for other things that require
typing names, such as the metric names. Questions are referenced by their question number
and interviewees can use their interviewee ID, and a short alias can be given so the feature is not provided.

// end::prefix[]

{empty} +

// tag::gui[]
=== GUI Convenience Features

==== Opening an Interview Session

It might be tedious opening an interview session via the open command `open <session>`, as session names can be very
long. As such, we have implemented a convenient way of opening interview sessions via the GUI.

In order to open the report of an interviewee, you can simply scroll to the interview session you want to open, and
double click on it!

==== Accessing Interviewee Resume

During an interview or while viewing the interview report of an interviewee, the user can open the interviewee's resume

[.big]##*Q*##: What happens if the app crashes halfway? Especially during an interview? +
[.big]##*A*##: *HireLah!* saves your work after every change. If the app crashes during an interview,

an "incomplete interview" state. You can simply resume the interview by calling
the `interview <interviewee>` command again. Note that you cannot perform the usual
decision phase commands (finding best interviewee, viewing report) on an interviewee whose
interview is incomplete!
