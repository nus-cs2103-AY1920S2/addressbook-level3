== Product Overview

ExpenseLa is for money-conscious NUS students who wish to track their spending, in order to make better informed decisions when it comes to saving money. ExpenseLa maintains a record of your daily incoming and outgoing transactions to constantly keep track of your finances! ExpenseLa is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still enjoying the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you want a simple, no-frills expense tracker, look no further than ExpenseLa!

== Quick Start (Hubert Halim)

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `expensela.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ExpenseLa.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  The UI has 5 different components: Command Input box, Command Result box, Monthly Data panel
Filter panel and Transaction List panel(Chart Analytics Panel)
+
image::UI_annotated.png[width="790"]
+
.  Filters are only to filter transaction list and chart analytics, MonthlyData is data for the current month and not the month
shown in the filter. So filter does not apply to MonthlyData.
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  You can navigate through your command history by pressing the kbd:[Up] or kbd:[Down] arrow key.
Only successful commands are stored in the command history. There can be at most 50 commands stored.
This feature is just like the command navigation feature in your favourite command line or shell.
.  An example command sequence you can try:

* *`clear`* : clear the expenseLa app to start at a clean slate
* *`budget b/1000 rc/`* : set a recurring budget of $1000 for the current month and subsequent months
* `add i/ c/Income n/salary a/2500 d/2020-04-02 rc/` : adds a recurring income with amount `$2500.00`
* **`add a/100`**`n/Wagyu Steak c/FOOD` : adds an expense named `Wagyu Steak` with amount `$100.00` spent on the day it is added in category `FOOD` to the expense tracker

=== Reset total balance `resetbalance` (Hubert Halim)

Reset `Balance` value to the total from the amount of all transactions in stored in the application so far.
This command is used in case the user makes a mistake when editing the json file or there is an unhandled bug in the app that
causes difference in the value of total balance and the net balance of all the transactions added together.
This command will rectify that issue.


=== Key in transaction : `add` (Fheng Guo Jing, Benjamin)

Adds an expense or income to the expense tracker. Expenses/incomes are stored as transactions.

Format: `add [i/] n/ NAME a/ AMOUNT [d/ DATE] [c/ CATEGORY] [r/ REMARK]  [rc/]`

Expected Outcome: A new transaction would be created in the list of transactions. If the newly
created transaction is part of the currently filtered transaction, it'll be visible in the list

[TIP]
Leaving the DATE option blank will auto fill with today's date
[TIP]
Leaving the CATEGORY option blank will auto fill with 'MISC' category
[TIP]
Not including i/ will make transaction an expense by default while including i/ will make it an income
[TIP]
Including rc/ will make transaction recurring every month on the same day set in the transaction date

Examples:

* `add a/ 26.00 n/ Grab Share d/ 2020-02-19 c/ TRANSPORT`

Expected Outcome: Filter is changed to the filter specified. List of transactions will only
show transactions that fulfill the filter criteria.

[TIP]
If only 1 filter type is specified (either category or month), the other filter type will automatically be set to "ALL".

Edit the specified transaction from the expense tracker

Format: `edit TRANSACTION_ID [n/ NAME] [a/ AMOUNT] [d/ DATE] [c/ CAT] [r/ REMARK]`

=== Analysis of transactions : `toggleview` (Choi Min Suk + Pang Kim Jin)

If filter is set to a specific month, the bar graph displays the transactions by day of the week. If filter is
set to all months, bar chart will display transactions by month for current and previous year. The pie chart will
show the transactions by the different categories according to the filter.


Expected Outcome: changed view to charts if previously was list view and to list view if previously was chart view.
