is a parameter which can be used as `inventory add ingredient i/Bacon q/10`).
* Words in square brackets are optional. +
 (e.g in `cookbook add recipe n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION [i/INGREDIENT]... [q/QUANTITY]... [s/STEP]... [t/TAG]...` can be

to add multiple ingredients and its respective quantities in the same command: `cookbook add recipe n/Sandwich
d/Delicious Sandwich i/Bread q/2 pieces i/Ham q/3 slices i/Cheese q/2 slices`).
* Parameters can be in any order. +
(e.g. if the command specifies `i/INGREDIENT q/QUANTITY`, `q/QUANTITY i/INGREDIENT` is a valid command).

* Command and delimiter (eg. i/, q/) formats given in the lowercase are *case-sensitive*. (eg `cookbook` is given as
all lowercase. `Cookbook` or `COOKBOOK` or `cOoKbOoK` are not valid.)

Additionally, parameters also cannot start with spaces. *Please follow the format given carefully for a seamless
