=== Command Format

(Contributed by Fatin and Gabriel)

This section shows you how all the commands in this guide have been formatted.

[width="%",cols="<20%a,<30%a,<50a",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Format | Meaning | Example

|
`lower_case/`

Any lower case letters, followed by a forward slash
|
These are *prefixes*.

They are used to separate the different parameters of a command.
|
These are prefixes: +
`n/`, `d/`, `t/`

Note that prefixes *cannot have spaces*: +
`n /` is *not a prefix*, and will not be recognized.

|
`UPPER_CASE`

Words in upper case
|
These are *parameters*.

You will need to supply parameters in order to complete certain commands.
|
You can create a *student* with the name *John Doe* using the `student add` command.

Suppose the `student add` command looks like this: +
`student add n/NAME`

Simply replace `NAME` with `John Doe` to create the student *John Doe*: +
`student add n/John Doe`

|
`[UPPER_CASE]`

Words in upper case, surrounded by square brackets
|
These are *optional parameters*.

Certain commands can be used without these parameters.
|
Suppose a command contains *two parameters* next to each other: +
`n/NAME [t/TAG]`

The *first parameter* `NAME` is *compulsory*. +
The *second parameter* `TAG` is *optional*.

Since a `TAG` is *optional*, you will be able to use the command with these *inputs*:

* `n/John Doe t/Fast learner`, or
* `n/John Doe`

|
`UPPER_CASE...`

`[UPPER_CASE]...`

An ellipsis `...` following any words in upper case
|
These are parameters that can be used *multiple times* or *none at all*.
|
The following parameter can be used *multiple times*: +
`t/TAG...`

This means that it can be:

* *Left empty* (i.e. 0 times): +
`t/`
* *Used one time* (i.e. 1 time): +
`t/friend`
* *Used multiple times* (i.e. 2 or more times): +
`t/friend t/family`

//end::commonparameters[]
//tag::duplicateparameters[]

==== Duplicate Parameters
(Contributed by Gabriel)

You can specify the same parameter *more than once* in a command.
Depending on the command, you will see *different outcomes*.

Here is a table explaining the different outcomes:

[width="%",cols="<20%a,<30%a,<50a",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
|
Parameter
|
Explanation
|
Example

|
Can be used multiple times
|
*All occurrences* will be used when executing the command
|
In the `student add` command, you can create a *student* with *multiple tags*.

Therefore, you can input multiple tags by chaining them: +
`t/needs help t/aka henry`

This will give a student the tags `needs help` and `aka henry`.

|
Can only be used once
|
The very *last occurrence* will be used when executing the command
|
`module add m/CS2103T n/SE n/Software Engineering`

If you execute this command, you will create a *module* with the name `Software Engineering`.

The name `SE` will be ignored.

|=======================================================================
//end::duplicateparameters[]
//tag::rearrangingparameters[]

==== Rearranging Parameters
(Contributed by Gabriel)

Parameters can be in *any order* if they have *prefixes*.

For example, if a command needs a `n/NAME` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER`, you can specify them in any order:

* `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, or
* `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`

However, if the command has a parameter *without a prefix*, that parameter *must* be
the very *first parameter*.

For example, if a command needs an `INDEX`, it must be the *first parameter*:

* `INDEX n/NAME` is valid, but
* `n/NAME INDEX` is invalid
//end::rearrangingparameters[]
//tag::layout[]

[[Layout]]
== Layout

(Contributed by Fatin)

This section gives you a brief overview of the layout of the *TA-Tracker*.

*TA-Tracker* is divided into three `tabs` representing the different *Views*:

* The *Student View* under the `student tab`,
* The *Session View* under the `session tab`, and
* The *Claims View* under the `claims tab`

When you switch to a `tab`, that `tab` will be highlighted in orange.

Furthermore, when you enter a new command, you will be automatically switched to the relevant `tab`
so that you can instantly see the result of the command.

[NOTE]
====
* You can *select* a `tab` to show a different *View*.
This `tab` will be highlighted in *blue*.

* If you are *switched* to a `tab` when you *enter a command*,
that `tab` will be highlighted in *orange*. +
+
This should help you easily remember
where you last made a change in *TA-Tracker*.

* You will sometimes see the `tabs` highlighted in both *orange* and *blue*. +
+
The *orange* `tab` will remain highlighted even if you select another `tab`.

* You may notice that the *orange* and *blue* highlights for the `tabs` are *not
the same size*. +
+
This is to *prevent* the highlights from *overlapping* each other,
allowing you to see them better.


image::Tabs.png[width="790"]
This shows what happens when you last made a change in the `student tab`
and then clicked on the `claims tab`.

//end::layout[]
//tag::studentview[]

=== Student View
(Contributed by Aakanksha)

Under the `student tab`, the *Student View* is used to show you the students that you're teaching. The students
have been grouped according to the *module* and *group* they belong to. The *Student View* has been divided into
three columns.

. The first column shows you a *list of all the modules* that you are a teaching
assistant for.

. The second column shows you a *list of all groups* that you're a teaching assistant
for *in a module of your choice*.
If you haven't chosen anything, you will be shown the groups of the module
in the *first index* in the list of modules by default.

. The third column shows you a *list of all students* in the *group of your choice*. If you
haven't chosen anything, you will be shown the students of the group in the
*first index* in the list of groups by default.

The purpose of the *Student View* is to help you keep track a of your students. It will
show you information such as:


* `NAME`: student name
* `MATRIC_NUMBER`: matriculation number
* `RATING`: ratings you have given the student, represented by stars (on a scale from 1 - 5)
* `EMAIL` and `PHONE`: contact details
* `TAG`: any additional information you have about the student

[NOTE]
====
The `RATING` value must be a positive integer.

Under the `session tab`, the *Session View* contains a list of the upcoming sessions
that you haven't done yet.

The sessions are automatically sorted by date.

The purpose of the *Session View* is to help you keep track a of your upcoming teaching.
duties. It will show you information such as:

* `SESSION_TYPE`: the type of session
* `DATE`: the date that the session will occur on
* `START` and `END`: the start time and end time of the session
* `MODULE`: the module that the session is under
* `NOTES`: any additional information

(Contributed by Fatin)

You can switch to different `tabs` with this command to show their associated *view*.

Format: `goto TAB_NAME`

[NOTE]
====
* You cannot switch to a `tab` that does not exist in TA-Tracker
====

====
Example:

`goto student`

image::GotoStudent.png[width="790"]
This command takes you to the `student tab`.

====
//end::goto[]
//tag::exit[]

==== Exiting the program : `exit`
(Contributed by Fatin)

You can *exit the program* with this command.

Format: `exit`
//end::exit[]
//tag::list[]

==== Listing all sessions : `list`
(Contributed by Chua Yi Jing)

`list` command shows you all the sessions under Session View and Claims View.

[TIP]
====
* You can use this command to display all your sessions after using the `session filter`
or `claims filter` command.
====
//end::list[]

=== Student View

This section explains all the commands you can use in the *Student View*.

//tag::addmodule[]
[[AddModule]]
==== Adding a Module : `module add`

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

You can use this command to *add a new module* to the TA-Tracker.

When a new module is created, the *Student View* will show the groups
and students of the new module.

You may notice that the *group list and the student list are empty*. This is because
you haven't added any groups or students to the module yet.

If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `module add m/MOD_CODE n/NAME`

[NOTE]
====
* You *can't* have two modules with the *same module code* in the TA-Tracker.

* `MOD_CODE` and `MOD_NAME` can't be a *empty or a sequence of spaces*.

* You can give a module your own *custom* `MOD_CODE` or `NAME` if you find it easier
to remember. However,  we recommend you use the *official
module code and name* for it.

* If the module name or module code are very long, you can *increase the width* of
the module name list by dragging the edge with your cursor. However, we suggest not
giving the modules long codes or long names. The standard official names are usually
of a good length.

====

[TIP]
====
* You can't edit the `MOD_CODE` once the module has been created, so do take
care to ensure that the code is correct.
====

====
Examples:

* `module add m/CS2100 n/Computer Organisation`
+

image::ModuleAdd.png[,1000]
This will add a module with the module code `CS2100` and name `Computer Organisation`
to the TA-Tracker.

//end::addmodule[]
//tag::deletemodule[]

[[DeleteModule]]
==== Deleting a Module : `module delete`

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

You can use this command to *delete a module* from the TA-Tracker.

When you delete a module, *all groups, students and sessions associated with
the module will also be deleted*.

When a module is deleted, the *Student View* will go back to its default
setting. That is, you will see the details of the *first group in the first module* of
the TA-Tracker.

If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `module delete m/MOD_CODE`

[NOTE]
====
* You *can't* delete a module that doesn't exist.
====

====
Examples:

* `module delete m/CS2103T`
+
image::ModuleDelete.png[,1000]
This will delete the module with the module code `CS2103T` from the TA-Tracker.
====
//end::deletemodule[]
//tag::editmodule[]

[[EditModule]]
==== Editing a Module : `module edit`

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

You can use this command to *edit a module's name* in the TA-Tracker.

When a module is edited, the *Student View* will show the *groups of the edited module* and
the students of the *first group* of the edited module. If you were on a different `tab`,
you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `module edit m/MOD_CODE n/NEW NAME`

[NOTE]
====
* You can only use this command to change the *name* of the module. The module
code *can't* be changed.

* Editing a module *doesn't affect the students and
groups* inside the module.

* MOD_NAME can't be a *empty or a sequence of spaces*.

* You *can't* edit a module that doesn't exist.
====

====
Examples:

* `module edit m/CS3243 n/Intro to AI`
+
image::ModuleEdit.png[,1000]

//end::editmodule[]
//tag::addgroup[]

[[AddGroup]]
==== Adding a Group : `group add`

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

You can use this command to *add a group* to a module in the TA-Tracker.

When a new group is created, the *Student View* will show the groups of the module
this new group belongs to and students of the new group.

You may notice that the list of students is empty. This is because you haven't added any
students to the group yet.

If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `group add g/GROUP_CODE m/MOD_CODE t/GROUP_TYPE`

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]

* `MOD_CODE` here refers to the module code of the module you want to add the group to.

* You *can't* add a group to a module that doesn't exist.

* The `GROUP_CODE` can't be a *empty or a sequences of spaces*.

* You *can't* add multiple groups with the same group code into the same module.

* You can give a group your own custom GROUP_CODE (ex: 10AMGROUP) if you find it easier
to remember. However,  we recommend you use the official
group code for it.
====

====
Examples:

* `group add g/G03 m/CS2100 t/tutorial`
+
image::GroupAdd.png[,1000]
This will add a group with the group code `G03`, which is a `tutorial`, inside the module that
has module code `CS2100`.
====
//end::addgroup[]
//tag::deletegroup[]

[[DeleteGroup]]
==== Deleting a Group : `group delete`

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

You can use this command to *delete a group* from the TA-Tracker.

When a group is deleted from the TA-Tracker, *all students in the group are also deleted*.

When a group is deleted, the *Student View* will show the details of the first group
of the module the group was deleted from.
If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `group delete g/GROUP_CODE m/MOD_CODE`

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]

* `MOD_CODE` here refers to the module code of the module that contains the group that
you want to delete.

* You *can't* delete a group from a module that doesn't exist.

* A group with the given group code *must* exist inside the module before you delete it.
====

====
Examples:

* `group delete g/G06 m/CS3243`
+
image::GroupDelete.png[,1000]
This will delete the group with the group code `G06` from the module that
has module code `CS3243`.
====
//end::deletegroup[]
//tag::editgroup[]

[[EditGroup]]
==== Editing a Group : `group edit`

(Contributed by Aakanksha)

You can use this command to *edit a group* in the TA-Tracker.

This command can be used to change the *group code and the group type* of the group.
The students inside the group will remain intact.

When a group is edited, the *Student View* will show the groups in the module that
the edited group belongs to, as well as the students that belong to the edited group.
If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `group edit g/GROUP_CODE m/MOD_CODE [ng/NEW_GROUP_CODE] [nt/NEW_GROUP_TYPE]`

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* `MOD_CODE` here refers to the module code of the module that contains the group that
you want to edit.

* You *can't* edit a group inside a module that doesn't exist.

* You *can't* edit a group that doesn't exist.

* If you are changing the group code, the module shouldn't contain a group that has the
same group code as the new group code.

* While the `nt/` and `ng/` prefixes are optional, at least one of them must be mentioned.
====

====
Examples:

* `group edit g/G01 m/CS3243 nt/lab`
+
image::GroupEdit.png[,900]
This will change the group type of the group with group code `G01`, inside the module with
module code `CS3243`, to be a `lab`.

==== Adding a Student : `student add`
(Contributed by Fatin and Gabriel)

You can use this command to add a new student to the TA-Tracker.

When a new student is added, the *Student View* will show that the new student
is added into the student list of the provided module group.
If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `student tab`.

Format: `student add id/MATRIC_NUMBER n/NAME m/MOD_CODE g/GROUP_CODE
[e/EMAIL] [r/RATING] [t/TAG]…​`

[NOTE]
====
[horizontal]
* You cannot add a student to a module that does not exist in the TA-Tracker.

* You cannot add a student to a group that does not exist inside the given module.

* You cannot add multiple students with the same matric number inside the same module group.

* Student names are auto-capitalized. However, if the name includes a hyphen (-) with no
space after the hyphen, the second half of the name will not be capitalised.

(Contributed by Chua Yi Jing)

You can use this command to add a new session.

The new session will be shown in the *Session View*, and will automatically
be marked as `not done`.

If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `session tab`.

Format: `session add m/MOD_CODE [s/START] [e/END] [d/DATE] [w/WEEKS] [t/SESSION_TYPE] [n/NOTES]`


[TIP]
====
. If you want to create a session with the current date, start time and end time,
you can omit `s/START` , `e/END` and `d/DATE`.

. You can edit the end time `e/END` and other details later by using the `session edit`
command (details given below in 5.3.3.).

. If the session has a recurring period `[w/WEEKS]`, a new session with the updated date
and timing will be added to *Session View* when it is marked as done.

. You will find the recurring period `[w/WEEKS]` field handy for tasks that happen once every few weeks
such as your weekly lab sessions or fortnightly assignment grading.

====

====
Examples:

* `session add m/CS3243 s/14:00 e/16:00 d/2020-06-20 w/2 t/consultation n/with Alice and Bob`

You can filter the sessions in the following ways:

* `MOD_CODE` - filtering by module code will show you only the sessions affiliated
with that module.

* `SESSION_TYPE` - filtering by session type will show you only the sessions with the specified type

* `DATE` - filtering by a date will show you only the sessions on that date.

The keyword is case-insensitive.

When you execute a new filter command, any previous filters applied on the sessions will
be removed and only the filters from the latest command will be applied on the sessions
list. The filters that are currently being applied are shown at the top of the *Session View*

If you were on a different `tab`, you will automatically be switched to the `session tab`.

Format: `session filter [m/MOD_CODE] [t/SESSION_TYPE] [d/DATE]`

====
Example:

* `session filter m/CS3243`
+
image::SessionFilter.png[width="790"]

== FAQ

(Contributed by Fatin and Aakanksha)

*Q*: How can I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: You can do so by first installing TA-Tracker on another computer. You can then replace
the empty data file it creates with the data file of your previous TA-Tracker folder.

*Q*: Is my data secure? +
*A*: TA-Tracker only stores your data locally on your device, and not on a cloud. This means that
the only possible way for there to be a security breach is to have someone access it on your physical
device, so do keep your belongings safe! You can be assured that cyber-attacks are not possible with
the way TA-Tracker is designed.

*Q*: How can I reset all of my data at once? +
*A*: You can do so by entering `clear` into TA-Tracker or by deleting `tatracker.json` in the data folder. Do take note
that there is no way for you to restore your data once it has been deleted.

*Q*: How can I uninstall TA-Tracker from my device? +
*A*: Simply delete the folder where you have placed TA-Tracker in.

*Q*: Is there any hidden payment involved in TA-Tracker? +
*A*: No, TA-Tracker is completely free to use! You can support us by contributing to our code-base https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W17-4/main[here].

*Q*: Can I create multiple instances of the app that store different data simultaneously? +
*A*: Yes, you can. Simply copy the `.jar` file into a different folder and run the app there. You will then be able
to use multiple different TA-Trackers at the same time

*Q*: Can I mark my students' attendance and give them grades? +
*A*: You can use the `rating` feature to give your students participation marks.
We are currently working on a way for you to give mark your students' attendance and
mark their assignments. You will see this feature in our next release.
