[[Terminology]]
== Terminology
_This section provides a quick description for the common terminologies used in this user guide._

*Task*: A task is something that you need to complete. It is represented as a card on the right side of the window. Set reminders, add tags and more to better manage your tasks!

*Pomodoro*: A productivity technique that consists of doing focused work for 25 minutes followed by a 5 minute break. This technique prevents you from tiring out while doing work.

*Pet*: The pet you will interact with to manage your tasks and pomodoros. You can also level up the pet by completing more tasks/pomodoros.

=== Indexes
[IMPORTANT]
====
Indexes refer to the current tasklist on display, it does not refer to the indices of the entire task list. Note also that indexes start from 1 and not 0.
====

== Graphical User Interface (Permas)
This section explains the function of the various GUI components present in BB Productive.

=== Pet View
The Pet View is where you can view your pet, its name, level and experience gained. With each task completed, the experience (XP) will increase (reflected in the progress bar too). The pet will evolve as it levels up with more XP gained, encouraging you to complete more tasks! This pet grows along with you as you become more productive! with more XP gained, encouraging you to complete more tasks! This pet grows along with you as you become more productive!

[[Pomodoro]]
=== Pomodoro
_This section describes the Pomodoro feature in detail and contains all commands you can use to take advantage of it_

==== What's Pomodoro?
In the late 1980s, a gentleman named Francesco Cirillo devised a time management method called the Pomodoro Technique. Essentially, a single cycle consists of two parts, 25 minutes of work, followed by a 5 minutes break. This cycle repeats for as long as you want to get work done.

==== How do you use it?
Trying to prevent burnout? BB productive offers you the option to try out the pomodoro tenchinique! The pomodoro technique breaks down work into manageable intervals spaced out with short breaks so as to not tired you out._

To get started, follow the instructions below:

===== Command: `pom`

First, you can activate the Pomodoro timer with a task in focus. You can also add an optional timer amount field, different from the default time of 25 minutes, for that particular cycle.

Format: `pom <index> [tm/<amount in minutes>]`

You can use the value (decimals allowed) following `tm/` to represent your desired amount of time in minutes for a particular pomodoro cycle.

.Example screen when pom is successfully executed.
image::pom_success.png[width=790]

===== Command: `pom pause`

You can pause a running Pomodoro timer.

.Example screen when pom is successfully paused
image::pom_pause.png[width=790]

===== Command: `pom continue`

You can resume a paused Pomodoro timer.

.Example screen when pom is successfully resumed
image::pom_continuing.png[width=790]


==== What happens when the timer's up?

===== "Done" the task
Once the timer expires, the app will prompt you if you have finished the task. You need only respond with Yes (Y) or No (N) in order to proceed.

.Prompt when the pomodoro timer expires
image::pom_time_expire.png[width=790]

===== Break-time
Afterwards, the app will prompt you if you would like to begin a 5 minute break (as per the pomodoro technique). Similarly, you need to respond with Yes (Y) or No (N). Responding with No will set the app to its neutral state. Yes will start the break timer.

.Prompt checking if you'd like to take a break
image::pom_prompt_break.png[width=790]

Note: You will not be able to do execute other commands during these prompts.

===== Back to work
At the end of the break, the app will return to it's "neutral" state and you can  repeat the process, if you wish.

.End of pomodoro cycle screen

=== Statistics (Permas)
The Statistics Tab consists of 2 features to help you keep track of your productivity. You can access this panel by using the “stats” command to switch to this tab.

.Statistics Tab
image::stats_tab.png[width=400]

==== Daily Challenge
The Daily Challenge is a progress bar that tracks the total duration you have kept the Pomodoro running in the current day. You can customise the duration you aim to achieve on a daily basis by using the Set Command as introduced in section 6.x //TODO link. Try to clear the Daily Challenge everyday to hit your productivity goals!

==== Productivity Chart
The Productivity Chart tracks the number of tasks done and duration you ran the Pomodoro per day for the past 7 days. This is done so that you can track your productivity progress over time. With this information. you can make adjustments to your schedule to improve your productivity.

=== AutoComplete
As much as you enjoy typing, we've added some extra grease to make you type even faster. You can trigger our very intelligent auto complete function by pressing `tab` on the keyboard.

You can expect: +

* Auto completion of command words: `del -> delete`
* Addition of prefixes for common values: `20/10/20@10:30 -> r/20/10/20@10:30`
** Figure 14
* Auto completion of sort fields `sort pri` -> `sort priority`
** Figure 15

.Prefix auto complete

If we can't find a valid command, you will observe feedback like below:
