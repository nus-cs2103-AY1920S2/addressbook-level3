== Introduction

Have you ever had trouble keeping track of your tutorials and students as a TA in NUS? TAble is your handy desktop app, optimized for TAs who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)! Mark attendance, arrange consults, add module notes, set reminders and more with TAble!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `TAble.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TAble.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`listStudent`* : lists all students
* **`deleteStudent`**`3` : deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

. Example of the Tutorial and Consult panels.
[NOTE]
The consults that are overdue will appear in red to highlight that these consults are ready to be deleted!

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addStudent name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addStudent name/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `name/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as `name/John Doe tag/friend` or as `name/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[tag/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME email/EMAIL`, `email/EMAIL name/NAME` is also acceptable.

*Command History*

* Navigate through the past command history by pressing the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.
[NOTE]
Only successfully executed commands will be added to list of command history.

*Autocompletion*

* TAble will suggest the available commands and prefixes based on your current input.
* Press kbd:[Tab] or kbd:[Enter] to accept the suggestion.
* Press kbd:[Esc] to cancel and close the suggestion pop-up.

===  Students Feature (Written by Chiang Shun De)
==== Adding a student: `addStudent`

Adds a student to TAble +
Format: `addStudent name/NAME matric/MATRIC_NUMBER email/EMAIL [tag/TAG]...`

[NOTE]
====
* Students name have a maximum length of 70 characters as it is the standard length for database fields.
* In TAble there can be duplicate names, but not duplicate emails and matric numbers as they are unique to each student.
* Tags are sorted alphabetically for easier referencing.
====

[TIP]
A student can have any number of tags (including 0), but each tag is limited to a length of 40 characters.
****
* The students name will be automatically formatted such that it follows a standard format of
the first letter of each word being uppercase and the rest lowercase, and a maximum of one space between each word. This
is done to follow proper naming convention, making it more presentable and readable,
and remedies any errors which may have happened when extracting the list of student names.
The removal of excess spaces is also done for tags.
** For example: `addStudent name/john      doe matric/A0123456X email/johnd@example.com`
adds a student with the name "John Doe" into the list.
****

Examples:

* `addStudent name/John Tan matric/A0123456X email/johnt@example.com`

Output:
....
New student added: John Tan Matric Number: A0123456X Email: johnt@example.com Tags:
....
* `addStudent name/Betsy Daphne Anne Lim matric/A1234567X tag/good student email/betsydaphneannelim@example.com tag/CS2103`
