== Introduction

Gov Tech has recently launched the TraceTogether app to combat the rapid spread of the COVID-19
infection. In their app, users who are within certain distances from each other will have
their interactions recorded via message exchange using bluetooth.

Our Contact Tracing App is an extension of the TraceTogether app. We forsee a scenario where
the government has collected all the user's (anonymized) bluetooth ping data and can not
perform analytics and visulization over them.

This is for efficient contract tracing, in order to make better policies when it comes to virus spreading control.
Our app allows efficient search over the data and generates a detailed report with record summary for upper
management review.

== Target audiences

We target mostly the analytics teams within government agencies, senior government managers and decision makers
are also our potantial users.

=== User personas

Our product is designed for the following personas:

* Tech savvy:

We assume that these users are familiar with technology and mediocre level of programming. They should be comfortable interacting with dashboards and would prefer more control over the software, as compared to the average user.

* Pressed for timing:

These users have to manage multiple projects in their day to day task. As such, speed of information retrieval and display is important to the functionality of the product, especially since we are dealing with a situation where a second delay may cause the infection to spread further.

* Rich:

The govt has too much money to throw around. We need not emphasise on cost cutting measures that reduces cost at the expense of system efficiency. We are not dealing with a start up here that lacks the funds needed to pay for our solution.

* Believes that security is paramount:

Not saying that security is not important for an application, just that we are dealing with government agencies and personal user data here.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `ContactTracing.jar` link:{releaseUrl}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  All PDF file report will be generated in './result' folder.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `from <ts: start> to <ts: end>`: Searches for all interactions from start to end timestamp
* `id is <user: id>`: Searches for all interactions with the user ID
* `pairs <user1: id> and <user2: id>`: Searches for all interactions with the containing user 1 and user 2
* `danger <threshold: counts>`: Searches for user pairs which has occured more than *threshold
* `person`: Shows all registered users in the system
* `person_by <person: id>`: Shows all information wrt to a user
* `person_add /name <person: name> /mobile <person: mobile> /nric <person: nric> /age <person: age>`: Adds a new user to the system
* `person_delete /userid <person: id>`: Deletes an existing user to the system

. With commands introduced above, users can save data points and summary into a PDF report.
. All reports will be saved to the ./result folder.
* `report from <ts:start> to <ts:end>` : Generate a report with all interaction in tha time range.
* `report id is <user: id>`: Generate a report with all interactions with a given user ID.
* `report pairs <user1: id> and <user2: id>`: Generate a report with all interactions containing user1 and user2.
* `report danger <threshold: counts>`: Generate a report with all danger cases.
* `report all`: Generate a report with all interaction cases.
* *`exit`* : Exits the app.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[[Features]]
== Features

=== Querying over collected trace data
==== Searching over timestamp : `From`
Retrieves collected trace data based on by timestamp filter.

Format: `from <ts: start> to <ts: end>`

Example:

* To view recorded pings from Epoch 1500000000 - 1500001000 : `from 1500000000 to 1500001000`
* To view all pings : `from 1 to 1500100000`

*Note: Currently accepted timestamp is in epoch timing.
For example on how to use the timing, refer link:{epochTiming}[here]

==== Searching over user ID : `id is`
Retrieves all trace data based on a given user id

Format: `id is <user: id>`

Example: `id is 1`

*Note: Currently we add 20 users into our database with userID from 1 to 20.

==== Searching over user ID pairs : `pairs`
Retrieves all trace data that contains interactions between 2 user pairs

Format: `pairs <user1: id> and <user2: id>`

Example: `pairs 1 and 12`

==== Searching for danger signs : `danger`
Identifies user pairs that are most at risk, based on occurrence spanning more than a threshold count.
These individuals are obviously not practicing good social distancing and are a threat to the community.

Format: `danger <threshold: counts>`

Example: `danger 5` will flag out user pairs which are present more than 5 times

=== Querying user related information
==== Searching all users: `person`
Shows all users registered in the system

Format: `person`

==== Filtering by user: `person_by`
Applies a filter to perform quick search on a user

Format: `person_by <person: id>`

Example: `person_by 1` will find information on user ID 1

==== Adding a new user: `person_add`
Registers a new user to the system

Format: `person_add /name <person: name> /mobile <person: mobile> /nric <person: nric> /age <person: age>`

Example: `person_add /name John David /mobile 9213 /nric S1323923P /age 50` adds a new user with fields

===== Constraints
* Sequence must abide in sequence /name, /mobile, /nric, /age

==== Adding a new user: `person_deletes`
Registers a new user to the system

Format: `person_delete /userid <person: id>`

Example: `person_delete /userid 1` deletes any record with user ID 1

=== Generating reports
==== Reporting all instances: `report all`
Report all interaction instances in database.

Example: `report all`

==== Reporting over time range: `report time`
Generate a report includes all interaction instances in a time range

Format: `report time from <ts: start> to <ts:end>`

Example: `report time from 1500000000 to 1500003000`

==== Report all danger cases: `report danger`
Generate a report with user pairs that are most at risk, based on occurrence spanning more than a threshold count.

Format: `report danger <threshold: count>`

Example: `report danger 10`

==== Report user pair cases: `report pairs`
Generate a report includes user pairs with given userIDs

Format: `report pairs <user1: id> and <user2: id>`

Example: `report pairs 1 and 12`

==== Report user with a given ID: `report id`
Generate a report includes interactions with a specific given ID

Format: `report id is <user: id>`

Example: `report id is 1`

==== Report information of each person in database: `report_person`
Generate a report with the information of all person data points in dababase

Format: `report_person`

==== Report information of a person with the given ID: `report_person id`
Generate a report with the information of a specific person with a a given ID

Format: `report_person <personID: count>`

Example: `report_person 1`

== FAQ

*Q*: Does the application need internet to run? +
*A*: *NO*. We will be using hardcoded data for this project. Any display data you see is meant
to simulate actual deployment conditions where our App will receive a steady stream of data.

*Q*: Will my personal data be protected well? +
*A*: There will be strict authority sytem to prevent privacy leak, Only people who have been
granted permission are able to get access to user privacy data and all data published to public will be
