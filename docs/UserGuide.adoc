== Introduction

Code Camp X (CCX) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app to manage the administrative tasks of running a coding camp*.
More importantly, CCX is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, CCX can allow you to manage your camp's administrative tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.
