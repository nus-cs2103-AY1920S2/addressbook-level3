== Introduction

InventoryManager is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their inventory*. More importantly, InventoryManager is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InventoryManager can get your inventory management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `inventorymanager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your InventoryManager.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds. For Mac OS users, permission may need to be granted to the file before usage.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list-s`* : lists all suppliers
* **`add`**`n/John Doe c/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 gp/apple 4.50` : adds a supplier named `John Doe` selling apples at 4.50 each to the InventoryManager.
* **`delete-s 3`** : deletes the 3rd supplier shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [gp/GOOD PRICE]` can be used as `n/John Doe gp/apple 4.50` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[gp/GOOD PRICE]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `gp/apple 4.50`, `gp/orange 2.00 gp/pear 5.00` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME c/CONTACT_NUMBER`, `c/CONTACT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* For parameters where only one value is expected, only the last specified value will be taken e.g. `c/12345 c/54321` will use only `c/54321`.

//tag::buycommand[]

[TIP]
If the good does not exist in the inventory, a new entry for that good will be created.

[CAUTION]
The maximum quantity of any good in the inventory is 999,999. Users are not allowed to buy quantities of goods that would cause that limit to be exceeded.
//end::buycommand[]

//tag::sellcommand[]

[TIP]
The selling price can be specified to the nearest cent, or 2 decimal places maximum.

When the quantity in inventory reaches 0, the name of the good is not deleted for future reference or restocking.
This entry can be deleted using the `delete-g` command.
//end::sellcommand[]


//tag::deletegood[]
