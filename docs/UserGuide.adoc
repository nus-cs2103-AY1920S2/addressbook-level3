== Layout
A brief overview of the layout of the TATracker.

=== Dashboard
Home page.

=== Student View
This view will show you the list of all your students. It will show you information such as student name, matriculation number, attendance, ratings you give the student(such as for participation), any notes you have on the student and contact details (email and telegram id).

=== Session View
This view will contain the upcoming tasks and statistics.

=== TSS View
This will show you all your claimable hours up till now in the same format as that used in the TSS claim files.

=== Automatic Backups
TATracker data is automatically saved in the hard disk as backup files after any command that changes the data. These automatic backups will preserve all data and settings within the program at the time of use. These backups will also be automatically loaded into the program when it is opened.
