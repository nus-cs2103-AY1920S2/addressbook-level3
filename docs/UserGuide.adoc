== Introduction
Nice & Amazing Student Assistant (NASA) is an application for *busy university students to manage their module
assignments, lessons, exams and other miscellaneous activities.*

*NASA has a user-centric Graphical User Interface optimized for users who prefer to work with the
Command Line Interface (CLI).* If you can type fast, NASA can keep track of all your module activities faster than
traditional GUI applications.

Interested? Ready to blast off on an exciting student journey? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve"
.  Download the latest `NASA.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all deadlines of each module
* **`add m/CS2103T n/Software Engineering`**: adds a module CS2103T `Software Engineering` to the list. Allows activities to be added to that module.
* **`deadline m/CS2103T d/20-02-2020 23:59 a/IP Project p/2 n/Must get an executable JAR file`** : adds an activity called IP Project with the following details into CS2103T module activity-list.
* **`del-d`**`1 m/CS2103T` : deletes the 1st deadline shown in the module deadline-list.
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

Note: during initialisation, modules may not fit full size of screen due to rendering speed. Please resize your
window to enable responsiveness of module size.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add m/MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_CODE` is a parameter which can be used as `add m/CS1231`.
* Items in square brackets are optional fields e.g `[n/Notes]`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[m/MODULE_CODE]...` means m/CS2103T CS2101 .....
* Parameters can be in any order.
* For items without `...`, should multiple values for the same field be provided e.g `m/CS2101 m/CS2103T`, only the last value will be used, unless stated otherwise.
* Commands are **case-insensitive**, unless stated otherwise.

=== Adding a module activity-list: `add`

Adds a module activity-list into the NASA application +
Format: `add m/MODULE_CODE n/MODULE_NAME`

Examples:

* `add m/CS2030 n/Programming Methodology II`
* `add m/CS1231 n/Discrete Structures in Mathematics`

[NOTE]
====
** Module name must not be empty and should only contain alphanumeric characters.
** Module name with consecutive multiple whitespaces will be trimmed to a single whitespace.
** Module code must contain 1-10 alphanumeric characters and not have any spaces. eg: `CS 2030` will not be accepted.
====

=== Adding a type of  activity into a module respective activity-list:
`Contributed by: kester-ng` +
Types of activities available and their description are displayed in the table below. Each type of activity has its own dedicated list in the module. How to add individual types of activities are listed in subsections below.

==== Deadline
`Contributed by: kester-ng` +
Deadlines are activities that needs to be completed by a certain date. An example is assignment or labs. Each module has its own deadline-list. See below image for details and how they are represented.

image::Deadline-list.png[]

====
** Deadlines have statuses: `not done` and `done`
** Deadlines have priorities and are represented by number of exclamation marks (top right corner). The number of them represents priority (the more the higher the priority).
** Whether a deadline is done or not is represented by a tick-box. From the above image, the first deadline `Lab 10` is done (ticked) but the others are not.
** Tick-box are not clickable, but can be toggled using `done` and `continue` command.
** The deadlines are highlighted in two colours - light blue and red. Blue indicates that the deadline is either not over yet or is already done. Red means it is overdue (due date passed and is not done).
====

==== Event
`Contributed by: kester-ng` +
Events are activities that occur for a stipulated period of time. Example of events can include tutorials, examinations and competitions. Each module has its own event-list. See below for details and how they are represented.

image::Event-list.png[]

====
** Events do not have priorities, the `done` nor `not done` statuses.
** Events instead have `ongoing/have not started` and `over` statuses.
** If the events are highlighted light blue then it is `ongoing/have not started`. If it is highlighted red, then it is `over`.
====

[NOTE]
====
** The statuses of deadlines and events are not updated on-the-go. Instead, use `refresh` command or restart the application to see the updated statuses.
====

==== Adding a deadline into a module's deadline-list: `deadline`:

=== Automating a activity: `repeat-d` or `repeat-e`

`Contributed by: EdmondOng`

Allows user to repeat-d an activity from a module.
Format: `repeat-d ITEM_INDEX m/MODULE_CODE r/INDEX`

**  The first `ITEM_INDEX` is the sequence of the activity in the list.
** `INDEX` can be in `1 for Weekly`, `2 twice Weekly`, `3 for Monthly`.
**  By default `INDEX` will be `0` hence no automation will be done.
**  The activity will be regenerated once user open the application or enters refresh command.

CAUTION:  Only use index r/0, r/1, r/2, r/3.

Examples:

** `repeat-d 1 m/CS3233 r/0` to cancel.
** `repeat-d 1 m/CS3233 r/1` to regenerate weekly.

// end::automation[]

// tag::quote[]
=== Quote: `quote`

`Contributed by: EdmondOng`

Allows user to generate a quote message. Aims to lighten the user day!
The message will disappear within 5s.

CAUTION:  Advise not to spam `quote` as the screen will be filled with quote messages waiting to disappear.
Use it when you need it.

Format: `quote`

Example :

** `quote` : “Limitations live only in our minds. But if we use our imaginations, our possibilities become limitless.” – Jamie Paolinetti

// end::quote[]

// tag::undoredo[]

=== Undo: `undo`

`Contributed by: EdmondOng`

Allows user to undo previous action.

CAUTION:  `quote`, `export` not supported.

Format: `undo`

Example :

** `undo` : "undo last action"

=== Redo: `redo`

`Contributed by: EdmondOng`

Allows user to redo previous action.

CAUTION:  `quote`, `export` not supported.

Example :

** `redo` : "redo last action" else "no last action to redo"

// end::undoredo[]

=== Calendar View:
`Contributed by: kester-ng` +
Allows the user to see the activities onto a calendar.

* Switch to calendar tab using TAB key.
* Switch to calendar tab by clicking on the tab.

Examples:

image::Calendar_View.png[width="300", align="middle"]

[TIP]
====
** Provides users with a great way to see what upcoming deadlines and events over the days, weeks or months.
** The calendar updates along with the activities being displayed. This means that if a user enters a `find` command and the activities that matches the keyword are only displayed on the module's tab. Then the calendar tab will also display the same few activities!
** This allows users to easily find their tasks and note down when is it going to happen or when is it due. Making it a more pleasant user experience!
** The individual date cells are scrollable. If any of your activities are not shown, hover your mouse over the dates and scroll down to find it!
====

=== Export Calendar: `calendar`
`Contributed by: kester-ng` +
Allows users to export the current calendar into an .ics format for other calendar applications +
Format: `calendar [p/FILE_PATH]`

====
** Exports the calendar into a .ics file named `nasa.ics` onto specified file path.
** If file path is not specified, the resulting .ics file can be found in the /data directory.
====

Examples:

** `calendar p/./nasa` +
exports the current calendar into nasa.ics file that is located at `./nasa` directory.

[NOTE]
====
** The export command will export all activities regardless of whether is it currently shown or not.
** Typing this command will cause all activities to be displayed!
** Deadlines are represented as a `VTODO` entry in the .ics file. And there are some calendars that do not support this (eg: Google calendar). Currently, deadlines will not be able to be displayed on such calendars. Will expand to support these types of calendars `[Coming in V2.0]`.
====

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort deadline and event: `sort`
`Contributed by: don-tay` +
Sorts all deadlines and events in their respective modules by a specified criteria. +
Format: `sort SORT_METHOD`

* All sort method will sort both deadline and event, unless stated otherwise. (eg. Priority)
* Where stated, a command will sort both deadline and event using different sort method. (eg. Due date and start date)

The list of sort methods is given in the table below: +

|===
|*Sort Method* |*Format* |*Sort order (top to bottom)*
|Lexicographical order (case-insensitive) |`sort name` | A to Z

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous NASA folder.

*Q*: What is the purpose of an event? +
*A*: An event can be CCAs, bookings, etc.

*Q*: How do I populate NASA with an activity (ie. Deadline, Event, Lesson) that occur regularly (eg. weekly)? +
*A*: Use the automate command (see section ‘Automation’)

*Q*: What are the differences between Deadline and Event? +
*A*: Both are describe the type of activity in a module. They are displayed in different parts of the NASA UI (ie. Deadline and Event panel, respectively)

*Q*: How many modules can I add into NASA? +
*A*: NASA is optimised to display up to 8 modules at once - More than enough modules for a university student in a semester. Should you exceed 10 modules, please delete existing modules before adding new modules.

*Q*: How many deadlines and events can I add into a module? +
*A*: There is no limit, so add away!

*Q*: Since every deadline is different how automation helps to keep track of my new deadline? +
*A*: The new deadline will be base on the interval when you first initialise the deadline activity. For example,
date of creating an activity is on 16-03-2020 00:00 and due date is on 20-03-2020 00:00. If you set repeat for a week,
the next due date will be 16 + 7 + 4 which is 27-03-2020 00:00.

*Q*: There is an unreported bug. What should I do? +
*A*: Please contact us here! We will respond as soon as possible.
