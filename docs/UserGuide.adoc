[[UserInterface]]
== User Interface

In this section, we look at the key features of Coupon Stash's
graphical user interface. The interface can be broadly split
into 4 different parts: the different tabs present in the
program (Coupons, Summary and Help), the calendar,
the command input box and the command result box.

.Coupon Stash main screen.
image::ug_user_interface.png[]

=== Tabs

Tab selection determines the content shown in the main
window of Coupon Stash.

The tabs can be switched by pressing kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Tab] or
by clicking on the tabs bar on the left side of the application
with the name of the tab you want to switch to. The current
selected tab will be highlighted with a bolder text, and a
darker blue.

.Coupon Stash summary tab.
image::ug_currently_selected_tab.png[]

[NOTE]
The tabs bar is visible on every single tab! It serves
as a good visual reference to tell you which
tab is currently being displayed.


The following sections explain the different features of
each tab of Coupon Stash, as well as how to use them.

[[couponstab]]
==== Coupons tab

When you first start Coupon Stash, the default selected tab
is the coupons tabs. The coupons tab contains a visual
overview of the coupons which you have added to the
application.

[[couponcard]]
===== Coupon card

The coupon card displays information about each coupon, and
it is styled to look like a coupon itself!

.Sample coupon card.
image::ShopeeCoupon.png[]

====
****
*Coupon Fields* +

- Name: Shopee - Name of the coupon. +
- Promo Code: NEWUSER - Promo code required to use the coupon at the merchant. +
- Expiry Date: 31-10-2020 - Expiry date of the coupon. +
- Start Date: 01-01-2020 - Start date of when the coupon can be used. +
- Remind Date: 28-10-2020 - A reminder will pop up when Coupon Stash

- Savings (blue box): $7.00, USB-C cable, iPhone case - Savings ($7) generated
from the use of this coupon. USB-C Cable and iPhone Case are saveables; free
items that come along with the use of this coupon.
- Tags (orange label): newuser - Tags to categorize coupons.
- Index (beside Tags): 1 - Index of the coupon on the displayed list. Used
accordingly with some commands of Coupon Stash.

****
====

[NOTE]
Duplicate coupons cannot exist in the active coupon list! Coupons are duplicates
when they have the same name, promo code, expiry date and savings.

==== Summary tab

The summary tab provides an overview of how much
you have saved from using coupons in Coupon Stash.

This tab provides an estimate of all the savings
you have accumulated, provided the coupon that resulted
in those savings is still present in Coupon Stash (this
includes <<archive, archived>> coupons). This estimate
is displayed in the form of a monetary amount at the
top of the page, with saved items that may not be easily
quantified displayed in a lime-green box at the side,
preceded by the text "And these saveables too!".

.Coupon Stash summary tab.
image::ug_summary_tab.png[]

Also, a graph that shows the monetary amount saved
every week is also displayed in the summary tab.
The next section will tell you more about how to
interpret this graph.

===== Savings graph

The savings graph provides a bar chart which holds
statistics on the amount of money saved per week.
The taller the bar, the more savings earned that week.
The exact amount is also shown in white text at the
top of each bar.

In the graph, Monday is taken to be the first day
of a week, and Sunday the last. The date displayed
on the bottom axis corresponds to the first day of that
week (Monday). Earlier weeks are displayed towards
the left, while later weeks are displayed towards
the right (direction of time axis is from left to right).

The graph is drawn based on the latest week in which
coupon usage was recorded by Coupon Stash, and shows
a maximum of 10 bars or 10 weeks of savings before that
latest date.

[TIP]
Any savings that were recorded by Coupon Stash before
the time period of 10 weeks will not be shown in the graph.
However, they can still be calculated using the
<<saved, saved command>>.

.Coupon Stash savings graph.
image::ug_savings_graph.png[]

[NOTE]
Although the total monetary amount and saveables list
in the summary tab is obtained by adding up all the
savings from every coupon regardless of the date,
the savings graph may not display every weeks' savings
as it only displays up to a maximum of 10 weeks.

==== Help tab

The help tab shows you a short description of how
to use all the commands in Coupon Stash.

[WARNING]
As compared to the User Guide's descriptions, the
descriptions provided in the help tab are less detailed!

[[calendar]]
=== Calendar

The calendar provides you with an overview of all your coupon's expiry dates within a month year. It reflects the expiry
dates of the list of coupons in the <<couponstab,`coupons tab`>>.


====
The calendar changes accordingly to the changes in the list of coupons in the <<couponstab,`coupons tab`>>. Hence,
the following commands that alters the list of coupons may also alter the calendar: +

// end::saved[]

// tag::archive[]
[[archive]]
=== Archiving a coupon: `archive`
Archives a coupon when you want to keep a record of it, without cluttering your
current stash of coupons.

[NOTE]
To view archived coupons, the user can run the
<<Listing coupons: `list`, `list a/`>> command to list all
archived coupons. Alternatively, the <<Finding coupons by name: `find`,
`find`>> command explained below will
search all archived coupons, thus displaying archives that match the supplied
keywords below unarchived coupons. Finally, the
<<Listing all expiring coupons: `expiring`, `expiring`>> command will also
include all archived coupons that are expiring in its results.
Read the section on <<Finding coupons by name: `find`, `find`>> and
<<Listing all expiring coupons: `expiring`, `expiring`>>
respectively to find out more.

Format: `archive INDEX`

****
* Archives the coupon at the specified <<index, INDEX>>.
****

Examples:

your coupons once their usage limit has been reached, or when they have expired.
// end::archive[]

// tag::unarchive[]
=== Unarchiving a coupon: `unarchive`
Unarchive a coupon, thus bringing it back to your active coupons list.

[NOTE]
To unarchive a coupon, you have to make sure that the archived coupon is
visible in the Coupon Stash first. Read the section on the
<<Archiving a coupon: `archive`, `archive`>> command to find out the ways that
you can display archived coupons.

Format: `unarchive INDEX`

****
* Unarchive the coupon at the specified <<index, INDEX>>.
****

Examples:

* `unarchive 1` +
Unarchive the first coupon in the coupon list.
// end::unarchive[]

// tag::find[]
=== Finding coupons by name: `find`

Find coupon(s) whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g mALa will match Mala.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Rice Chicken will match
Chicken Rice.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. Chicken will not match Chickens.
* Coupons matching at least one keyword will be returned.
e.g. Chicken Rice will return Duck Rice, Chicken Chop.
****

[TIP]
For easy finding of coupons, include the store or brand
name in your coupon name!

Examples:

* `find ken` +
For example, coupons with the keyword **ken** would be returned: +
**Ken** Kitchen, **KEN** RIDGE Optical, **ken** you build a snowman.

[NOTE]
The <<Finding coupons by name: `find`, `find`>> command searches the
<<Archiving a coupon: `archive`, `archive`>> for matches too. Coupons that are
found
in the <<Archiving a coupon: `archive`, `archive`>> are displayed **below** the
non-archived matches.

// end::find[]

// tag::expiring[]
=== Listing all expiring coupons: `expiring`

Shows a list of all your coupons expiring on a date or during a
<<coupon-stash-monthyear-format, month year>>.

[NOTE]
This command will change the month year on display in the <<calendar, calendar>> to the month year of specified
<<coupon-stash-date-format, expiry date>> or <<coupon-stash-monthyear-format, month year>>. +
For example, `expiring e/30-9-2020` & `expiring my/9-2020` both changes the month year on display in the
<<calendar, calendar>> to September 2020.

Format: `expiring e/EXPIRY_DATE` or `expiring my/MONTH_YEAR`

****
* Lists all coupons that are expiring on the specified expiry date or during
the specified month year.
* The <<coupon-stash-date-format, expiry date>> or <<coupon-stash-monthyear-format, month year>> must follow the
<<coupon-stash-date-format, Coupon Stash date format>>
or the <<coupon-stash-monthyear-format, Coupon Stash MonthYear format>>
respectively.
****

Examples:

* `expiring e/30-9-2020` +
Shows you all the coupons that expire on 30 September 2020.

* `expiring my/9-2020` +
Shows you all the coupons that expire during September 2020.

displayed **below** the non-archived matches.
// end::expiring[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sorting coupons: `sort`

Sorts the coupons in Coupon Stash in **ascending** order. It is possible to sort
by coupon name, expiry date, or remind date.

[WARNING]
When you <<Editing a coupon: `edit`, `edit`>> or
<<Adding a coupon: `add`, `add`>> a coupon, the sorting order will revert to
the original order. Otherwise, the sorting order will persist throughout the
runtime of the  program.

[NOTE]

<<archive, archived>> coupons, if they are present on
screen. <<archive, Archived>> coupons will always appear
**below** active coupons.

Format: `sort PREFIX`

****
* The `PREFIX` can be either `n/`, `e/` or `r/`.

****

Examples:

Sorts the Coupon Stash by name in ascending order.
* `sort e/` +
Sorts the Coupon Stash by expiry date from earliest to latest.
* `sort r/` +

// end::sort[]

// tag::copy[]
=== Copying a coupon: `copy`
Copies a coupon as an <<Adding a coupon: `add`, `add`>> command to your
clipboard so that you can easily share it with your friends/family!

Format: `copy INDEX`

****
* Copies the coupon at the specified <<index, INDEX>>.
* The <<Adding a coupon: `add`, `add`>> command of the coupon will be copied to

[TIP]
If you clear your Coupon Stash on accident, you can
use <<Undoing the previous command: `undo`, `undo`>> to restore
your Coupons! Just make sure you don't close the application
immediately after you cleared your Coupons.
// end::clear[]

// tag::exit[]
=== Exiting the program: `exit`

This command immediately exits the program when entered.
When you exit the program, all coupon data is saved to
your computer. +
Format: `exit`

[NOTE]
There are many ways of exiting the program! One other way
is to click the cross at the top of the application (position
of this cross button differs depending on operating system).
// end::exit[]

// tag::reminding[]
=== Reminding of coupon expiry

By default, all added coupons have a remind date that is 3 days before its
stated expiry date. This default value can be changed during the process of
<<_adding_a_coupon_add, adding>> a new coupon or by
<<_editing_a_coupon_edit, editing>> an existing coupon. The remind dates for all
coupons are checked on program launch. All coupons that have a remind date which
falls on the date of program launch will be listed in a popup window on launch.
The popup window can be closed by pressing kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[q].

.Popup window showing all coupons that have their remind dates set on the date of program launch.
image::ug_reminder_window.PNG[]

[WARNING]
Remind dates are **only** checked during program launch. Thus, if a day passes
while the program is open, even if there are coupons expiring on the new day,
no new reminder window will open.

As of now, there is no
functionality for the disabling of reminders for coupons. This feature will be
made available in version 2.0.

====
* The format of dates entered via the `r/` field is
in the D-M-YYYY format. (<<coupon-stash-date-format, Coupon Stash date format>>)
====

Examples:

* `add n/McDonald's McGriddles p/ILOVEMCGRIDDLES e/31-12-2020 s/$2
   sd/1-4-2020 l/2 t/value t/savoury`
+
Add a new Coupon without specifying a remind date. Note that the default
remind date is 3 days before the state expiry date:

.New coupon with a default remind date.
image::ug_mcdonalds_mcgriddles.png[]

* `add n/Grabfood s/40% e/30-4-2020 p/GRAB40 t/delivery r/10-4-2020`
+
Add a new Coupon while specifying a remind date of `10-04-2020`:

.New coupon with remind date set to `10-04-2020`.
image::ug_Grabfood_reminder.png[]

* `edit 1 r/10-4-2020`
+
Edit the coupon at index 1 and change its remind date to `10-4-2020`.

// end::reminding[]

Coupon data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any
command that changes the data.

There is no need to save manually.

== Keyboard Shortcuts
With Coupon Stash being optimized for efficient command line usage, how can we
not include some nifty keyboard shortcuts to further streamline
your workflow! This section introduces some of the keyboard shortcuts available
for use in this program.

=== Restore previously entered command texts: kbd:[↑] and kbd:[↓]
Pressing the kbd:[↑] keyboard button while the focus is on the command box
allows you to restore the text of the previous executed command. Pressing
the kbd:[↓] keyboard button allows you to revert to a more recently entered
command.

Demonstration:

After <<Expanding a coupon: `expand`, `expanding`>> a coupon, you can close
the expanded coupon window by keeping the focus on the coupon window and
pressing the keyboard buttons kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[q] simultaneously. This
shortcut also works for closing <<_reminding_of_coupon_expiry, reminder>>
windows.

Demonstration:

== Appendix

This section talks about features that have not been
implemented in Coupon Stash yet, but features that
the developers are keen to add in upcoming versions.

=== *Query expressions (coming in v2.0)*

Query expressions serve to enable users to perform efficient batch
operations on stored coupons using SQL-like syntax.

Examples:

* `edit favorites set tag=hated where expiry < 19-2-2020` +
For all coupons tagged as ``favorites'', set their tag to ``hated'' if
they expire before the 19th Feb 2020.

* `delete favorites where expiry < 19-2-2020` +
For all coupons tagged as ``favorites'', delete them if they expire
before the 19th Feb 2020.


==== *Bulk edit*

Format: `edit _tag_ set _field1=value1, field2=value2, …_ [where
condition]`

* The `edit` keyword is compulsory.
** If selecting all tags, put tag as `*`.
* The `set` keyword is compulsory.
** If the field is present in a coupon, update the value, else create
the field and value.
** At least 1 field must be updated/added per edit operation.
* The `where` keyword is optional.
** The `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `!=`, operators are
supported in the condition.
** Only default fields can be compared.
** Condition syntax: `DEFAULT_FIELD _operator_ LITERAL_VALUE`
** `AND`/`OR` functionality is not available.

==== *Bulk delete*

Version 2.0 will bring new features like confirmation
of coupons before they are deleted!

Also, a "recycle bin" is in the works for version 3.0,
similar to the Recycle Bin in Microsoft Windows.


Format: `delete _tag_ [where condition]`

* The `delete` keyword is compulsory.
** If selecting all tags, put tag as `*`.
* The `where` keyword is optional.
** If the `where` keyword is omitted, deletes all coupons with that tag.
** Follows syntax explained above.
