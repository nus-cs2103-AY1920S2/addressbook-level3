== Introduction

NusProductivity is an application for better management of your school work. The app will allow you to keep track of the modules you have taken, allow you to map your module out to plan for future modules. More importantly, NusProductivity is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
