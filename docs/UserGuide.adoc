== Introduction

Are you a Teaching Assistant at School of Computing who is tired of having to keep track of all your claimable hours in some unappealing excel spreadsheet just so you can fill up the TSS Claims form accurately at the end of the semester?
Do you want a place where you can keep track of everything related to your teaching duties, including keeping a track of your strongest and weakest students?
If so, TA-Tracker is the tool for you!

TA-Tracker is a productivity tool made for NUS Computing Teaching Assistants (TAs) who want to be able to track and manage their students and all of their claimable hours in NUS in one place.

TA-Tracker is tailored towards TAs who *prefer to use a desktop application to manage their teaching duties* and is well suited for those who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).If you're interested, jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
. Download the latest `tatracker.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your TA tracker.
. Double-click the file to start the app.
The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

. Refer to <<Usage>> for details of each command.

NOTE: TA-Tracker data is saved periodically.

[[Layout]]
== Layout

This is a brief overview of the layout of the TA-Tracker.
The TA-Tracker is divided into three different views - the Student View, the Session View and the Claims View.

=== Student View

Under tha students tab, the Student View is used to show you the students that you're teaching.
The students have been grouped according to module and group.
The Student view has been divided into three sections.

The first section shows a list of all the modules that you are a teaching assistant for.

The second section shows a list of all groups in a module of your choice.
If you haven't chosen anything, by default you will be shown the groups of the module in the first index in the list of modules.

The third section shows a list of all students in the group of your choice.
If you haven't chosen anything, by default you will be shown the students of the group in the first index in the list of groups.

The purpose of the student view is to allow a TA to keep track of their students.
It will show you information such as student name, matriculation number, ratings you have given the student and contact details such as email and telegram id.

=== Session View

Under the sessions tab, the Session View contains the upcoming tasks that you have.

=== Claims View

Under the claims tab, the Claim View contains the list of all the claimable hours you have completed so far.

The purpose of this view is to allow a TA to keep track of all their claims so that they can easily enter it into the TSS claims form at the end of the semester.
