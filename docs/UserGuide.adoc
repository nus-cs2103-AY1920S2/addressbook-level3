== Introduction
This user guide provides in-depth documentation on the Delino desktop application:
quick start guide, features, FAQ, command summary, and glossary.

Delino is for couriers who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their delivery tasks*.
It is *optimised for those who have a strong preference towards Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still enjoying the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Sounds interesting? Have a quick look at our tutorial <<Quick Start>> to get started.
Have a delightful journey using Delino!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `Delino.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Delino.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* <<list, `list`>> : lists all orders to be delivered.
* <<add, `add`>> `tid/1023456789` `n/Amos Cheong` `a/Blk 572 Hougang st 51 #11-37 S530572` `p/9001 0019` `dts/2020-03-10 1650` `w/Marsiling` `pm/Nets` `c/Leave it at the riser type/glass` : adds an order where the receiver name is `Amos Cheong` into Delino.
* <<delete, `delete`>> `3` : deletes the 3rd delivery order shown in the current list
* <<exit, `exit`>> : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for a more detailed explanation of each command.
