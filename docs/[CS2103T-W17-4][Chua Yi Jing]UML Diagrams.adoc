The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the sequence of commands that take place between
the `Logic` and `Model` components of the TA-Tracker
when the user enters the command
`session done 1`.

1. The `LogicManager` uses the `TaTrackerParser` to first parse the user command.

2. The `TaTrackerParser` sees that the command is a `Session` command and passes the command
to the `SessionCommandParser`.

3. The `SessionCommandParser` sees that the command is a `DoneSessionCommand` and passes the
arguments to the `DoneSessionCommandParser`.

4. The `DoneSessionCommandParser` creates a `DoneSessionCommand` with the given index.

5. `LogicManager` calls `DoneSessionCommand#execute()` method.

6. The `DoneSessionCommand`
checks whether the current session called by the user has a recurring period.

a. If it does, a new session with the updated date will be added to `Model#UniqueSessionList()`.
b. If it does not have a recurring period, it will move on to *Step 6*.

7. The current session is marked as done and will be removed from `Model#UniqueSessionList`.

8. The updated session list will be displayed to the user.

The _Activity Diagram_ below summarises what happens when the user executes a `filter` command:

The following _Sequence Diagram_ shows the sequence of commands that take place between
the `Logic` and `Model` components of the Ta-Tracker when the user enters the command
`student filter m\CS2103T g\G06`. This command will return students from module code `CS2103T`, under group `G06`.

The following _Class Diagram_ shows how different classes are related in the functioning of
the `SessionFilter` Command.

[NOTE]
====
* The lifeline of a class in a Sequence Diagram should end at the destroy marker(X).
However, due to a limitation of *PlantUML*, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.
