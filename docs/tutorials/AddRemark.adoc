== Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the implementation of a new command -- `remark`.

This command allows users of the AddressBook application to add optional remarks to people in their address book and edit it if required.
The command should have the format of `remark INDEX r/REMARK`.
An example of the command is `remark 2 r/Likes baseball`.

We'll assume that you have already set up the development environment as outlined in the Developer's Guide.



----
package seedu.eylah.addressbook.logic.commands;

import seedu.eylah.addressbook.splitterModel.Model;

/**
 * Changes the remark of an existing person in the address book.
 */
public class RemarkCommand extends Command {

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "remark";

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model splitterModel) {
        return new CommandResult("Hello from remark");
    }
}
----



=== Run the application





=== Make the command accept parameters



=== Parse user input

Now let's move on to writing a parser that will extract the index and remark from the input provided by the user.

Create a `RemarkCommandParser` class in the `seedu.address.logic.parser` package.
The class must implement the `Parser` interface.

.The relationship between Parser and RemarkCommandParser

Thankfully, `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` makes it trivial to parse user input.
Let's take a look at the JavaDoc provided for the function to understand what it does.

[source, java]
.ArgumentTokenizer.java
----
/**
 * Tokenizes an arguments string and returns an {@code ArgumentMultimap}
 * object that maps prefixes to their respective argument values. Only the
 * given prefixes will be recognized in the arguments string.
 *
 * @param argsString Arguments string of the form:
 * {@code preamble <prefix>value <prefix>value ...}
 * @param prefixes   Prefixes to tokenize the arguments string with
 * @return           ArgumentMultimap object that maps prefixes to their
 * arguments
 */
----

We can tell `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to look out for our new prefix `r/` and it will return us an instance of `ArgumentMultimap`.
Now let's find out what we need to do in order to obtain the Index and String that we need.
Let's look through `ArgumentMultimap` :

[source, java]
.ArgumentMultimap.java
----
/**
 * Returns the last value of {@code prefix}.
 */
public Optional<String> getValue(Prefix prefix) {
    List<String> values = getAllValues(prefix);
    return values.isEmpty() ? Optional.empty() :
        Optional.of(values.get(values.size() - 1));
}
----

This appears to be what we need to get a String of the remark.
But what about the Index? Taking a quick peek at existing an `Command`...


There appears to be another utility class that obtains an `Index` from the input provided by the user.





NOTE: Don't forget to update `AddressBookParser` to use our new `RemarkCommandParser`!

If you are stuck, check out the sample link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/commit/efdcdf0e80cec9489f7b47e3f65824f4688ad8f7#diff-fc19ecee89c3732a62fbc8c840250508[here].

== Add `Remark` to the splitterModel

Now that we have all the information that we need, let's lay the groundwork for some _persistent_ changes.
We achieve that by working with the `person` splitterModel.
Each field in a Person is implemented as a separate class (e.g. a `Name` object represents the person's name).
That means we should add a `Remark` class so that we can use a `Remark` object to represent a remark given to a person.

=== Add a new `Remark` class

Create a new `Remark` in `seedu.address.splitterModel.person`. Since a `Remark` is a field that is similar to `Address`, we can reuse a significant bit of code.

A copy-paste and search-replace later, you should have something like link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/commit/b7a47c50c8e5f0430d343a23d2863446b6ce9298#diff-af2f075d24dfcd333876f0fbce321f25[this].
Note how `Remark` has no constrains and thus does not require input validation.



== Add a placeholder element for remark to the UI

Without getting too deep into `fxml`, let's go on a 5 minute adventure to get some placeholder text to show up for each person.

Simply add
[source, java]
.PersonCard.java
```
@FXML
private Label remark;
```

to link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/commit/2758455583f0101ed918a318fc75679270843a0d#diff-0c6b6abcfac8c205e075294f25e851fe[`seedu.eylah.addressbook.ui.PersonCard`].
`@FXML` is an annotation that marks a private or protected field and makes it accessible to FXML.
It might sound like Greek to you right now, don't worry -- we will get back to it later.

Then insert

```
<Label fx:id="remark" styleClass="cell_small_label" text="\$remark" />
```
into link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/commit/2758455583f0101ed918a318fc75679270843a0d#diff-12580431f55d7880578aa4c16f249e71[`main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml`].

That's it! Fire up the application again and you should see something like this:

.$remark shows up in each entry

== Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field

Since `PersonCard` displays data from a `person`, we need to update `person` to get our `Remark` displayed!

=== Modify `Person`

We change the constructor of `person` to take a `Remark`.
We will also need to define new fields and accessors accordingly to store our new addition.

=== Update other usages of `Person`

Unfortunately, a change to `person` will cause other commands to break, you will have to modify these commands to use the updated `person`!

TIP: Use the `Find Usages` feature in IntelliJ IDEA on the `person` class to find these commands.

Refer to link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/commit/b241ef8526bd4e8a6ad94b8118b7fc3441ec8fa3#diff-3462fc1118b9872387a01b41157b0402[this commit] and check that you have got everything in order!

== Updating Storage

AddressBook stores data by serializing `JsonAdaptedPerson` into `json` with the help of an external library -- Jackson.
Let's update `JsonAdaptedPerson` to work with our new `person`!

While the changes to code may be minimal, the test data will have to be updated as well.

WARNING: You must delete AddressBook's splitterStorage file located at `/data/addressbook.json` before running it!
Not doing so will cause AddressBook to default to an empty address book!

Check out link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/commit/ce4f9b70f524d2395948861d80d57fda9ae6e82e#diff-07708562699e2436c717f3330bafae1e[this commit] to see what the changes entail.

== Finalizing the UI

Now that we have finalized the `person` class and its dependencies, we can now bind the `Remark` field to the UI.

Just add link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/commit/56d5cb662c31dd38b02f6a5301ba6ab3c667d6a3#diff-0c6b6abcfac8c205e075294f25e851fe[this one line of code!]
[source, java]
.PersonCard.java
----
public PersonCard(Person person, int displayedIndex) {
    //...
    remark.setText(person.getRemark().value);
}
----

.The remark label is bound properly!

== Putting everything together

After the previous step, we notice a peculiar regression -- we went from displaying something to nothing at all.




== Writing tests

Tests are crucial to ensuring that bugs don't slip into the codebase unnoticed. This is especially true for large
code bases where a change might lead to unintended behavior.

Let's verify the correctness of our code by writing some tests!

=== Automagically generating tests

The goal is to write effective and efficient tests to ensure that `RemarkCommand#execute()` behaves as expected.

The convention for test names is _``methodName_testScenario_expectedResult``_.
An example would be `execute_filteredList_success`.

Let's create a test for `RemarkCommand#execute()` to test that adding a remark works.
On `IntelliJ IDEA` you can bring up the context menu and choose to `Go To` > `Test` or use the appropriate keyboard shortcut.

.Using the context menu to jump to tests
image::ContextMenu.png[, 1223px, 267px]

Then, create a test for the `execute` method.

.Creating a test for `execute`.
image::CreateTest.png[, 664px,751px]

Following convention, let's change the name of the generated method to `execute_addRemarkUnfilteredList_success`.

Let's use the utility functions provided in `CommandTestUtil`. The functions ensure that commands produce the expected `CommandResult` and output the correct message.


You should end up with a test that looks something like

== Conclusion

This concludes the tutorial for adding a new `Command` to AddressBook.
